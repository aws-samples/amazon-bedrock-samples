Services page. Also, for more information, see Regional endpoints in the AWS general reference guide.\nWhat is the service availability of SageMaker?,  SageMaker is designed for high availability. There are no maintenance windows or scheduled downtimes. SageMaker APIs run in Amazon proven high-availability data centers, with service stack replication configured across three facilities in each Region to provide fault tolerance in the event of a server failure or Availability Zone outage.\nHow does SageMaker secure my code?,  SageMaker stores code in ML storage volumes, secured by security groups and optionally encrypted at rest.\nWhat security measures does SageMaker have?,  SageMaker ensures that ML model artifacts and other system artifacts are encrypted in transit and at rest. Requests to the SageMaker API and console are made over a secure (SSL) connection. You pass AWS Identity and Access Management roles to SageMaker to provide permissions to access resources on your behalf for training and deployment. You can use encrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets for model artifacts and data, as well as pass an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to SageMaker notebooks, training jobs, and endpoints to encrypt the attached ML storage volume. SageMaker also supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and AWS PrivateLink support.\nDoes SageMaker use or share models, training data, or algorithms?,  SageMaker does not use or share customer models, training data, or algorithms. We know that customers care deeply about privacy and data security. That's why AWS gives you ownership and control over your content through simplified, powerful tools that allow you to determine where your content will be stored, secure your content in transit and at rest, and manage your access to AWS services and resources for your users. We also implement technical and physical controls that are designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your content. As a customer, you maintain ownership of your content, and you select which AWS services can process, store, and host your content. We do not access your content for any purpose without your consent.\nHow am I charged for SageMaker?,  You pay for ML compute, storage, and data processing resources that you use for hosting the notebook, training the model, performing predictions, and logging the outputs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc3d67fe-6f9b-4917-8e95-694e5779d2f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc3d67fe-6f9b-4917-8e95-694e5779d2f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff56dcf8-d168-4e57-a03c-976913961495", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dda90ebd852e1b502dab886a853c7e6f380fd6d783fefb58a3111ef928f1ce59"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5fa446f-c19b-4c00-a825-d0acf69685b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f32f7a4f167202fb4e99448a115daa64757af17f32d31ebdc6d08c7437c5b647"}, "3": {"node_id": "45cd0422-7c2f-44a8-b556-0270ff695720", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "26fabfdb34c6284b8c1ac53d02faaa5af4197f5b177045da34b335a1db26b4f1"}}, "hash": "2961635ddc45faea58dbe7db0031e50f0fed32654b7f1151ebbb09eeea87bb97", "text": "With SageMaker, you can select the number and type of instance used for the hosted notebook, training, and model hosting. You pay only for what you use, as you use it; there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments. For more details, see Amazon SageMaker Pricing and the Amazon SageMaker Pricing Calculator.\nHow can I optimize my SageMaker costs, such as detecting and stopping idle resources to avoid unnecessary charges?,  There are several best practices that you can adopt to optimize your SageMaker resource usage. Some approaches involve configuration optimizations; others involve programmatic solutions. A full guide on this concept, complete with visual tutorials and code samples, can be found in this blog post.\nWhat if I have my own notebook, training, or hosting environment?,  SageMaker provides a full and complete workflow, but you can continue using your existing tools with SageMaker. You can easily transfer the results of each stage in and out of SageMaker as your business requirements dictate.\nIs R supported with SageMaker?,  Yes. You can use R within SageMaker notebook instances, which include a preinstalled R kernel and the reticulate library. Reticulate offers an R interface for the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK, helping ML practitioners build, train, tune, and deploy R models. \nHow can I check for imbalances in my model?,  Amazon SageMaker Clarify helps improve model transparency by detecting statistical bias across the entire ML workflow. SageMaker Clarify checks for imbalances during data preparation, after training, and ongoing over time, and also includes tools to help explain ML models and their predictions. Findings can be shared through explainability reports.\nWhat kind of bias does SageMaker Clarify detect?,  Measuring bias in ML models is a first step to mitigating bias. Bias may be measured before training and after training, as well as for inference for a deployed model. Each measure of bias corresponds to a different notion of fairness. Even considering simple notions of fairness leads to many different measures applicable in various contexts. You must choose bias notions and metrics that are valid for the application and the situation under investigation. SageMaker currently supports the computation of different bias metrics for training data (as part of SageMaker data preparation), for the trained model (as part of Amazon SageMaker Experiments), and for inference for a deployed model (as part of Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45cd0422-7c2f-44a8-b556-0270ff695720": {"__data__": {"id_": "45cd0422-7c2f-44a8-b556-0270ff695720", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff56dcf8-d168-4e57-a03c-976913961495", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dda90ebd852e1b502dab886a853c7e6f380fd6d783fefb58a3111ef928f1ce59"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc3d67fe-6f9b-4917-8e95-694e5779d2f7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2961635ddc45faea58dbe7db0031e50f0fed32654b7f1151ebbb09eeea87bb97"}, "3": {"node_id": "af230bc7-6ae7-4db1-8c3a-847f507f14bb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77b1df831d11bb03666e93c0b1e0a8b8045aeb8f22a8d70c7c7690d5ce780227"}}, "hash": "26fabfdb34c6284b8c1ac53d02faaa5af4197f5b177045da34b335a1db26b4f1", "text": "For example, before training, we provide metrics for checking whether the training data is representative (that is, whether one group is underrepresented) and whether there are differences in the label distribution across groups. After training or during deployment, metrics can be helpful to measure whether (and by how much) the performance of the model differs across groups. For example, start by comparing the error rates (how likely a model's prediction is to differ from the true label) or break further down into precision (how likely a positive prediction is to be correct) and recall (how likely the model will correctly label a positive example).\nHow does SageMaker Clarify improve model explainability?,  SageMaker Clarify is integrated with SageMaker Experiments to provide a feature importance graph detailing the importance of each input for your model\u2019s overall decision-making process after the model has been trained. These details can help determine if a particular model input has more influence than it should on overall model behavior. SageMaker Clarify also makes explanations for individual predictions available through an API. \nWhat is Amazon SageMaker Studio?,  SageMaker Studio provides a single, web-based visual interface where you can perform all ML development steps. SageMaker Studio gives you complete access, control, and visibility into each step required to prepare data and build, train, and deploy models. You can quickly upload data, create new notebooks, train and tune models, move back and forth between steps to adjust experiments, compare results, and deploy models to production all in one place, making you much more productive. All ML development activities including notebooks, experiment management, automatic model creation, debugging and profiling, and model drift detection can be performed within the unified SageMaker Studio visual interface.\nWhat is RStudio on Amazon SageMaker?,  RStudio on SageMaker is the first fully managed RStudio Workbench in the cloud.

SageMaker can automatically distribute deep learning models and large training sets across AWS GPU instances in a fraction of the time it takes to build and optimize these distribution strategies manually. The two distributed training techniques that SageMaker applies are data parallelism and model parallelism. Data parallelism is applied to improve training speeds by dividing the data equally across multiple GPU instances, allowing each instance to train concurrently. Model parallelism is useful for models too large to be stored on a single GPU and require the model to be partitioned into smaller parts before distributing across multiple GPUs. With only a few lines of additional code in your PyTorch and TensorFlow training scripts, SageMaker will automatically apply data parallelism or model parallelism for you, allowing you to develop and deploy your models faster. SageMaker will determine the best approach to split your model by using graph partitioning algorithms to balance the computation of each GPU while minimizing the communication between GPU instances. SageMaker also optimizes your distributed training jobs through algorithms that fully utilize the AWS compute and network in order to achieve near-linear scaling efficiency, which allows you to complete training faster than manual open-source implementations.\nWhat is Amazon SageMaker Training Compiler?,  SageMaker Training Compiler is a deep learning (DL) compiler that accelerates DL model training by up to 50 percent through graph- and kernel-level optimizations to use GPUs more efficiently. SageMaker Training Compiler is integrated with versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch in SageMaker, so you can speed up training in these popular frameworks with minimal code changes.\nHow does SageMaker Training Compiler work?,  SageMaker Training Compiler accelerates training jobs by converting DL models from their high-level language representation to hardware-optimized instructions that train faster than jobs with the native frameworks. More specifically, SageMaker Training Compiler uses graph-level optimization (operator fusion, memory planning, and algebraic simplification), data flow-level optimizations (layout transformation, common sub-expression elimination), and backend optimizations (memory latency hiding, loop oriented optimizations) to produce an optimized model training job that more efficiently uses hardware resources and, as a result, trains faster.\nHow can I use SageMaker Training Compiler?,  SageMaker Training Compiler is built into the SageMaker Python SDK and SageMaker Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2985fe62-a53a-434c-aebb-98444a7b6d84": {"__data__": {"id_": "2985fe62-a53a-434c-aebb-98444a7b6d84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff56dcf8-d168-4e57-a03c-976913961495", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dda90ebd852e1b502dab886a853c7e6f380fd6d783fefb58a3111ef928f1ce59"}, "2": {"node_id": "06de1c03-177e-49f7-aaa1-841f81e13c2b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a1eb52c5715faeb4e810e4e0d6cbf13f1f7b6d511b9fa365d14bafb1817f6ebf"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d544353-a47f-4c27-9731-495e392ed8e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66cbf4202702f3dd7a1c257abf70e1604e4e183e3c82b4de5da37c86ae91a563"}}, "hash": "742adfbc76815d59f62a8e58fb2094b68e6a619b8938622c524218c7a1369117", "text": "You don\u2019t need to change your workflows to access its speedup benefits.

You pay only for the duration of running the inference code and the amount of data processed, not for idle periods.\nWhy should I use SageMaker Serverless Inference?,  SageMaker Serverless Inference simplifies the developer experience by eliminating the need to provision capacity up front and manage scaling policies. SageMaker Serverless Inference can scale instantly from tens to thousands of inferences within seconds based on the usage patterns, making it ideal for ML applications with intermittent or unpredictable traffic. For example, a chatbot service used by a payroll processing company experiences an increase in inquiries at the end of the month while for rest of the month traffic is intermittent. Provisioning instances for the entire month in such scenarios is not cost-effective, as you end up paying for idle periods. SageMaker Serverless Inference helps address these types of use cases by providing you automatic and fast scaling out of the box without the need for you to forecast traffic up front or manage scaling policies. Additionally, you pay only for the compute time to run your inference code (billed in milliseconds) and for data processing, making it a cost-effective option for workloads with intermittent traffic.\nWhat is Provisioned Concurrency for SageMaker Serverless Inference?,  Provisioned Concurrency allows you to deploy models on serverless endpoints with predictable performance, and high scalability by keeping your endpoints warm for specified number of concurrent requests. Q. Why should I use Provisioned Concurrency? With on-demand serverless endpoints, if your endpoint does not receive traffic for a while and then your endpoint suddenly receives new requests, it can take some time for your endpoint to spin up the compute resources to process the requests. This is called a cold start. A cold start can also occur if your concurrent requests exceed the current concurrent request usage. The cold start time depends on your model size, how long it takes to download your model, and the start-up time of your container. To reduce variability in your latency profile, you can optionally enable Provisioned Concurrency for your serverless endpoints. With Provisioned Concurrency, your serverless endpoints are always ready and can instantaneously serve bursts in traffic, without any cold starts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffacd6a1-55f3-4d8c-b847-d0ccfaa8539d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffacd6a1-55f3-4d8c-b847-d0ccfaa8539d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff56dcf8-d168-4e57-a03c-976913961495", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dda90ebd852e1b502dab886a853c7e6f380fd6d783fefb58a3111ef928f1ce59"}, "2": {"node_id": "4157f79e-e0e5-4dcc-87d1-c4dd7f9325f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "93f2254fd44dc773cc149090ca58953522cea4d550f417649eb3522338857d7e"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f260125-81af-4d85-92b4-90d924cd011b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2c50bf8417c5b631acb3a9d63fc814c43cb9b1bf0cdcad444583379269a0b71"}}, "hash": "c8df71385fb3bff47a0009ed26768b78f03c9119dbfa47564fa2df36fcf6ace5", "text": "How will I be charged for Provisioned Concurrency?,  As with on-demand Serverless Inference, when Provisioned Concurrency is enabled, you pay for the compute capacity used to process inference requests, billed by the millisecond, and the amount of data processed.

For more information, see Amazon SageMaker Pricing.\nWhat is SageMaker shadow testing?,  SageMaker helps you run shadow tests to evaluate a new ML model before production release by testing its performance against the currently deployed model. SageMaker deploys the new model in shadow mode alongside the current production model and mirrors a user-specified portion of the production traffic to the new model. It optionally logs the model inferences for offline comparison. It also provides a live dashboard with a comparison of key performance metrics, such as latency and error rate, between the production and shadow models to help you decide whether to promote the new model to production.\nWhy should I use SageMaker for shadow testing?,  SageMaker simplifies the process of setting up and monitoring shadow variants so you can evaluate the performance of the new ML model on live production traffic. SageMaker eliminates the need for you to orchestrate infrastructure for shadow testing. It lets you control testing parameters such as the percentage of traffic mirrored to the shadow variant and the duration of the test. As a result, you can start small and increase the inference requests to the new model after you gain confidence in model performance. SageMaker creates a live dashboard displaying performance differences across key metrics, so you can easily compare model performance to evaluate how the new model differs from the production model.\nWhat is Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender?,  SageMaker Inference Recommender reduces the time required to get ML models in production by automating performance benchmarking and tuning model performance across SageMaker ML instances.

Previously, data scientists who wanted to deploy their models had to run manual benchmarks to select the right endpoint configuration. They had to first select the right ML instance type out of the 70+ available instance types based on the resource requirements of their models and sample payloads, and then optimize the model to account for differing hardware. Then, they had to conduct extensive load tests to validate that latency and throughput requirements are met and that the costs are low. SageMaker Inference Recommender eliminates this complexity by making it easy for you to: 1) get started in minutes with an instance recommendation; 2) conduct load tests across instance types to get recommendations on your endpoint configuration within hours; and 3) automatically tune container and model server parameters as well as perform model optimizations for a given instance type.\nHow does SageMaker Inference Recommender work with other AWS services?,  Data scientists can access SageMaker Inference Recommender from SageMaker Studio, AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), or AWS CLI.

Then, the compiler generates binary code for the optimized operations and writes them to a shared object library. The compiler also saves the model definition and parameters into separate files. During execution, the SageMaker Neo runtime loads the artifacts generated by the compiler\u2014model definition, parameters, and the shared object library to run the model.\nDo I need to use SageMaker to train my model in order to use SageMaker Neo to convert the model?,  No. You can train models elsewhere and use SageMaker Neo to optimize them for SageMaker ML instances or AWS IoT Greengrass supported devices.\nWhich models does SageMaker Neo support?,  Currently, SageMaker Neo supports the most popular DL models that power computer vision applications and the most popular decision tree models used in SageMaker today. SageMaker Neo optimizes the performance of AlexNet, ResNet, VGG, Inception, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet models trained in MXNet and TensorFlow, and classification and random cut forest models trained in XGBoost.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5012afe-d674-4f0d-a36f-4ba9d8f5829b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5012afe-d674-4f0d-a36f-4ba9d8f5829b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff56dcf8-d168-4e57-a03c-976913961495", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dda90ebd852e1b502dab886a853c7e6f380fd6d783fefb58a3111ef928f1ce59"}, "2": {"node_id": "50572466-18e0-40a7-bae8-8e530ab9a742", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "67419223c6dd06658a1bb1ed0bc25608c6590b20016978ad255846da7b07fdff"}, "3": {"node_id": "1606a918-3824-4cbb-b056-35f6c6906de7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e6654550ba1067a57519b30e759363bdb9128f26b94daa6d23a6ee94ddab4c3"}}, "hash": "e3f37883edfc9ee212a16b4526856b0cec821326aabee004182049338d28e282", "text": "Which hardware platforms does SageMaker Neo support?,  You can find the lists of supported cloud instances, edge devices, and framework versions in the SageMaker Neo documentation.\nIn which Regions is SageMaker Neo available?,  To see a list of supported Regions, view the AWS Regional Services list.\nWhat are Amazon SageMaker Savings Plans?,  SageMaker Savings Plans offer a flexible usage-based pricing model for SageMaker in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one- or three-year term. SageMaker Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs by up to 64%. These plans automatically apply to eligible SageMaker ML instance usages, including SageMaker Studio notebooks, SageMaker On-Demand notebooks, SageMaker Processing, SageMaker Data Wrangler, SageMaker Training, SageMaker Real-Time Inference, and SageMaker Batch Transform regardless of instance family, size, or Region. For example, you can change usage from a CPU instance ml.c5.xlarge running in US East (Ohio) to an ml.Inf1 instance in US West (Oregon) for inference workloads at any time and automatically continue to pay the Savings Plans price.\nWhy should I use SageMaker Savings Plans?,  If you have a consistent amount of SageMaker instance usage (measured in $/hour) and use multiple SageMaker components or expect your technology configuration (such as instance family, or Region) to change over time, SageMaker Savings Plans make it simpler to maximize your savings while providing flexibility to change the underlying technology configuration based on application needs or new innovation. The Savings Plans rate applies automatically to all eligible ML instance usage with no manual modifications required.\nHow can I get started with SageMaker Savings Plans?,  You can get started with Savings Plans from AWS Cost Explorer in the AWS Management Console or by using the API/CLI. You can easily make a commitment to Savings Plans by using the recommendations provided in AWS Cost Explorer to realize the biggest savings. The recommended hourly commitment is based on your historical On-Demand usage and your choice of plan type, term length, and payment option. Once you sign up for a Savings Plan, your compute usage will automatically be charged at the discounted Savings Plans prices and any usage beyond your commitment will be charged at regular On-Demand rates.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1606a918-3824-4cbb-b056-35f6c6906de7": {"__data__": {"id_": "1606a918-3824-4cbb-b056-35f6c6906de7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff56dcf8-d168-4e57-a03c-976913961495", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dda90ebd852e1b502dab886a853c7e6f380fd6d783fefb58a3111ef928f1ce59"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5012afe-d674-4f0d-a36f-4ba9d8f5829b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e3f37883edfc9ee212a16b4526856b0cec821326aabee004182049338d28e282"}}, "hash": "2e6654550ba1067a57519b30e759363bdb9128f26b94daa6d23a6ee94ddab4c3", "text": "How are Savings Plans for SageMaker different from Compute Savings Plans for Amazon EC2?,  The difference between Savings Plans for SageMaker and Savings Plans for Amazon EC2 is in the services they include.
