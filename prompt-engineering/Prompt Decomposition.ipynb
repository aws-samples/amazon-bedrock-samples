    "# Prompt Decomposition\n",
    "This notebook contains an example of prompt decomposition, or taking one long prompt and breaking it down into smaller parts.  These smaller parts can then be run independantly, often in parallel, and often on smaller models.  This can lead to significant performance enhancements and cost savings, may increase quality, and will make your prompts much easier to maintain as the workload grows.  This is because each step can be maintained and tested independantly, without any tweaks on one step impacting all the others (which may occur if they're all one huge prompt).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three common times when Prompt Decomposition can be helpful:\n",
    "  1) Preprocessing of RAG or context data.  For example, if context data is large, such a a long support document, consider a prompt that summarizes that content once, then future queries retrieve the summary rather than the long document. \n",
    "  2)  Breaking multi-step prompts into a maintainable DAG.  This can be helpful when a prompt reads like code, with a large number of steps or if/then instructions.  Instead, consider breaking these out and generating a flow diagram, resulting in maintainable individual pieces.\n",
    "  3)  Streamlining long linear prompts.  Even where prompts have only a single logical flow, if they are long, it can help to break the flow into small, sequential steps.  These steps combined may execute faster than the long original prompt, and they can also be maintained and tested independently. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook follows this structure:\n",
    "  1) Set up the envionment\n",
    "  2) Examples of decomposition"
