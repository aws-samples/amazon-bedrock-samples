Great Gatsby By F. Scott Fitzgerald The Great Gatsby Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;   If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,   Till she cry ‘Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,   I must have you!’ —THOMAS PARKE D’INVILLIERS comChapter 1 In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave  me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind  ever since. ‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,  ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had  the advantages that you’ve had.’ He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually  communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he  meant a great deal more than that.

Most of the con - fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,  preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some  unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver - ing on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young  men or at least the terms in which they express them are  usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
