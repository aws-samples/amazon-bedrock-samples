Great Gatsby By F. Scott Fitzgerald The Great Gatsby Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;   If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,   Till she cry ‘Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,   I must have you!’ —THOMAS PARKE D’INVILLIERS comChapter 1 In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave  me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind  ever since. ‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,  ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had  the advantages that you’ve had.’ He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually  communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he  meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m in - clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up  many curious natures to me and also made me the victim  of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to  detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a  normal person, and so it came about that in college I was  unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy  to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the con - fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,  preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some  unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver - ing on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young  men or at least the terms in which they express them are  usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.  Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still  a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my fa -The Great Gatsby ther snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense  of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at  birth. And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to  the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded  on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point  I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from  the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in  uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want - ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses  into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his  name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby  who represented everything for which I have an unaffect - ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful  gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,  some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he  were related to one of those intricate machines that register  earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness  had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which  is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness  such as I have never found in any other person and which  it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned  out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what  foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily  closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short- winded elations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in  this middle-western city for three generations. The Car - comraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that  we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the ac - tual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who  came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and  started the wholesale hardware business that my father car - ries on today. I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look  like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled  painting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New  Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father,  and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic mi - gration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid  so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the  warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like  the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and  learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond  business so I supposed it could support one more single  man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were  choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—ye- es’ with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance  me for a year and after various delays I came east, perma - nently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two. The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was  a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns  and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office sug - gested that we take a house together in a commuting town  it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather  beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the  last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went The Great Gatsby out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a  few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish  woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut - tered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove. It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,  more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. ‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked helpless - ly. I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I  was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casu - ally conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood. And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves  growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I  had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over  again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much  fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giv - ing air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and  investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and  gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold  the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Mae - cenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many  other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one  year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials  for the ‘Yale News’—and now I was going to bring back all  such things into my life and become again that most limited  of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man.’ This isn’t just an  epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a  single window, after all. comIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a  house in one of the strangest communities in North Ameri - ca. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself  due east of New York and where there are, among other  natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty  miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in  contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into  the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western  Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.  They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus  story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but  their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual  confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a  more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every  particular except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the  two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bi - zarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My  house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the  Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented  for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.
