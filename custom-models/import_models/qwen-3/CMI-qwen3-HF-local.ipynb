    "# Import a finetuned Qwen3 model from HuggingFace into Amazon Bedrock CMI, using SageMaker JupyterLab environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Model Import (CMI) is a feature that allows you to import model artifacts of certain model architectures to Amazon Bedrock and run them in a **serverless way**. For more information on CMI check the [Bedrock documentation on CMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-customization-import-model.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The challenge\n",
    "---\n",
    "In order for CMI to work, model artifacts need to be on an S3 bucket. The size of model artifacts nowadays can be quite large (e.g. exceeding 100GB) which can create issues with downloading them locally. In this notebook we will show how to download large Qwen 3 model artifacts from HuggingFace to JupyterLab environment in SageMaker Studio, and import them to Bedrock using CMI, in order to have serverless access to different types of Qwen 3 models. The same approach can be generalized for any other model artifacts from all the supported families in CMI. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be focusing on the following steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Configuring SageMaker Studio and the JupyterLab environment, in order to allow receiving large model artifacts.\n",
    "- Downloading the model artifacts from HuggingFace locally to JupyterLab.\n",
    "- Uploading the model artifacts to S3.\n",
    "- Initiating a CMI job.\n",
    "- Performing inference on the imported model.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",

    "In order to run this notebook, you need the right IAM permissions. Specifically:\n",

    "- You need appropriate Permissions to access model files in Amazon S3. \n",
    "- You need a S3 bucket to store the custom model artifacts (later to be imported to Bedrock using CMI).\n",
    "- Sufficient local storage space (this is what we will be setting up next).\n",
