    "# Amazon Bedrock Guardrails for Agentic AI Applications\n\nThis notebook demonstrates how to protect AI agents from security attacks using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.\n\n## \ud83d\udcca What This Demo Shows\n\n**Without Guardrails:** See how various attacks can manipulate or extract information from the AI agent.\n\n**With Guardrails:** See how Amazon Bedrock Guardrails blocks these attacks in real-time.\n\n## \ud83c\udfe5 Healthcare Agent Overview\n\nThis is an **AI-powered healthcare support agent** that helps patients manage their healthcare needs through natural conversation.\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n- \ud83d\udc64 **Patient Information** - Look up demographics, contact details, insurance information\n- \ud83d\udcb0 **Billing & Payments** - Check outstanding balances and payment history\n- \ud83d\udcc5 **Appointments** - View upcoming and schedule new appointments\n- \ud83d\udc8a **Medications** - View current prescriptions\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f How the Agent Works\n\nThe agent follows an **agentic workflow** powered by a Large Language Model (LLM):\n\n1. **User Input** \u2192 Patient asks a question in natural language\n2. **Reasoning** \u2192 LLM (Claude) understands the intent and decides what to do\n3. **Tool Selection** \u2192 Agent chooses which tools to call (e.g., `get_patient_info`, `get_billing_info`)\n4. **Tool Execution** \u2192 Tools query the mock patient database and return structured data\n5. **Response Generation** \u2192 LLM synthesizes tool results into a natural language response\n6. **Output** \u2192 Patient receives a helpful answer\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Security with Bedrock Guardrails\n\n**What are Guardrails?**\n\nAmazon Bedrock Guardrails provide **safety and security controls** that are applied at multiple points in the agentic workflow to protect against attacks and ensure responsible AI behavior.\n\n**Where Guardrails are Applied:**\n\nThis demo uses **two separate guardrails** at different stages:\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Main Guardrail (Input/Output)\n\nApplied to:\n- \ud83d\udd35 User inputs (before LLM)\n- \ud83d\udd35 Agent outputs (after LLM)\n\n**Policies Enabled:**\n- \u2705 Prompt attack detection (jailbreak, injection)\n- \u2705 Content filtering (hate, violence, etc.)\n- \u2705 Topic policy (denied topics like medical prescriptions)\n- \u2705 PII anonymization\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Tool Output Guardrail\n\nApplied to:\n- \ud83d\udfe2 Tool results (before LLM sees them)\n\n**Policies Enabled:**\n- \u2705 Prompt attack detection only\n\n**Why Two Guardrails?**\n\n- **Content filtering** applies to user inputs and agent outputs, but NOT to database query results\n- **Prompt attack detection** applies everywhere - including tool outputs to catch indirect injection\n- **PII anonymization** only needs to happen on final outputs to users\n- **Topic policies** apply to user requests and agent responses, but NOT to structured database records\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Approach\n\nThis demo uses the **ApplyGuardrail API** for flexible guardrail integration:\n\n- **Input/Output Protection**: `ApplyGuardrail` is called before sending user input to the LLM and after receiving the response\n- **Tool Output Protection**: Agent hooks (using Strands SDK `AfterToolCallEvent`) intercept tool results and apply guardrails before the LLM sees them\n\nThis approach gives you fine-grained control over where and how guardrails are applied in your agentic workflow.\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Attack Scenarios\n\nThis notebook tests 6 attack scenarios:\n\n| # | Scenario | Attack Type | Description |\n|---|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| 0 | **Baseline** | PII Anonymization | Normal inquiry demonstrating PII protection |\n| 1 | **Prompt Leakage** | PROMPT_ATTACK | Trick model into revealing system prompt |\n| 2 | **Indirect Task Hijacking** | PROMPT_ATTACK | Educational framing to bypass restrictions |\n| 3 | **Direct Task Override** | PROMPT_ATTACK | Debug framing to override role |\n| 4 | **Tool Poisoning** | PROMPT_ATTACK | Malicious instructions in tool output |\n| 5 | **Jailbreak** | PROMPT_ATTACK | Training simulation to bypass safety |\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.8+\n- AWS credentials configured\n- Amazon Bedrock access with Claude Sonnet model enabled"
