    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to building a chatbot using GenAI LLMs, RAG is a popular architectural choice. It combines the strengths of knowledge base retrieval and generative models for text generation. Using RAG approach for building a chatbot has many advantages. For example, retrieving responses from its database before generating a response could provide more relevant and coherent responses. This helps improve the conversational flow. RAG also scales better with more data compared to pure generative models and it doesn’t require fine tuning of the model when new data is added to the knowledge base. Additionally, the retrieval component enables the model to incorporate external knowledge by retrieving relevant background information from its database. This approach helps provide factual, in-depth and knowledgeable responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG Challenges\n",
    "Despite clear advantages of using RAG for building Chatbots, there are some challenges when it comes to applying it for practical use. \n",
    "In order to find an answer, RAG takes an approach that uses vector search across the documents. The advantage of using vector search is the speed and scalability. Rather than scanning every single document to find the aswer, using RAG approach, we would turn the texts (knowledge base) into embeddings and store these embeddings in the database. The embeddings are compressed version of the documents, represented by array of numerical values. After the embeddings are stored,  vector search queries the vector database to find the similarity based on the vectors associated with the documents. Typically vector search will return the top k most relevant documents based on the user question, and return the k results. However, since the similarity algorithm in vector database works on vectors and not documents, vector search does not always return the most relevant information in the top k results. This directly impacts the accuracy of the response if the most relevant contexts are not available to the LLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "A proposed solution to address the challenge of RAG approach is called Reranking. Reranking is a technique that can further improve the responses by selecting the best option out of several candidate responses. Here is how reranking could work, described in the sequential order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The chatbot generates its top 5 response candidates using RAG.\n",
    "2. These candidates are fed into a reranking model. This model scores each response based on how relevant, natural and informative they are.\n",
    "3. The response with the highest reranking score is selected as the context to feed the LLM in generating a response .\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, reranking allows the chatbot to filter out poor responses and pick the best one to send back. This further improves the quality and consistency of the conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "The following architecture dipicts a 2 stage retrieval by integrating a vector DB, an LLM and a reranking model. In the diagram, we will demonstrate how this could easily be built using Knowledge Base for Bedrock and a reranking model. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/rag-reranking-architecture.png\" alt=\"bedrock-reranking\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to demonstrate how to build a solution from the above architecture. Additionally, we'll also evaluate the performance of each approach (i.e. standard RAG approach vs RAG + reranking model) and perform analysis and share the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",

    "2. In order to run this notebook successfully, you would first deploy a reranking model.

The code for deploying the model is available in [deploy-reranking-model-sm.ipynb](deploy-reranking-model-sm.ipynb) in this directory. If you haven't deployed the reranking model, please proceed to the notebook and complete the steps, then come back and continue with this notebook."

    "### How it works\n",
    "Knowledge base for Amazon Bedrock help you take advantage of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a popular technique that involves drawing information from a data store to augment the responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). With this approach, your application can query the knowledge base to return most relevant information found in your knowledge base to answer the query either with direct quotations from sources or with natural responses generated from the query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main processes involved in carrying out RAG functionality via Knowledge Bases for Bedrock:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-processing - Ingest source data, create embeddings for the data and populate the embeddings into a vector database.\n",
    "2. \n",
    "3. Runtime Execution - Query the vectorDB for similar documents based on user query and return topk documents as the basis for the LLM to provide a response.\n",
    "The following diagrams illustrate schematically how RAG is carried out. Knowledge base simplifies the setup and implementation of RAG by automating several steps in this process.\n",

    "### Faithfullness\n",
    "This measures the factual consistency of the generated answer against the given context. It is calculated from answer and retrieved context. The answer is scaled to (0,1) range. Higher the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated answer is regarded as faithful if all the claims that are made in the answer can be inferred from the given context. To calculate this a set of claims from the generated answer is first identified. Then each one of these claims are cross checked with given context to determine if it can be inferred from given context or not. \n",

    "### Answer Relevancy\n",
    "The evaluation metric, Answer Relevancy, focuses on assessing how pertinent the generated answer is to the given prompt. A lower score is assigned to answers that are incomplete or contain redundant information. This metric is computed using the question and the answer, with values ranging between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate better relevancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Relevancy\n",
    "This metric gauges the relevancy of the retrieved context, calculated based on both the question and contexts. The values fall within the range of (0, 1), with higher values indicating better relevancy.\n",

    "### Answer Correctness\n",
    "The assessment of Answer Correctness involves gauging the accuracy of the generated answer when compared to the ground truth. This evaluation relies on the ground truth and the answer, with scores ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates a closer alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth, signifying better correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer correctness encompasses two critical aspects: semantic similarity between the generated answer and the ground truth, as well as factual similarity. These aspects are combined using a weighted scheme to formulate the answer correctness score. Users also have the option to employ a ‘threshold’ value to round the resulting score to binary, if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer Similarity\n",
    "The concept of Answer Semantic Similarity pertains to the assessment of the semantic resemblance between the generated answer and the ground truth. This evaluation is based on the ground truth and the answer, with values falling within the range of 0 to 1. A higher score signifies a better alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring the semantic similarity between answers can offer valuable insights into the quality of the generated response. This evaluation utilizes a cross-encoder model to calculate the semantic similarity score.\n",

    "To perform RAG evaluation on both the standard RAG and the two stage retrieval with a reranking model approach, we used an open source framework RAGAS focusing on *context relevancy*, *answer relevancy*, *answer similarity* and *answer correctness*.
