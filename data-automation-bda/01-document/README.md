# Document processing and insights using BDA

Customers can use Amazon Bedrock Data Automation to automate complex intelligent document processing tasks, such as document splitting, classification, data extraction, output format normalization, and validation. This simplifies the automation of IDP workflows and helps customers deliver business value faster by reducing operational complexity and improving processing efficiency, allowing them to handle higher volumes, minimize errors, and drive operational excellence.

In this section, we will work through document labs using various sample documents, observe the output generated by BDA, and briefly discuss how users can leverage these outputs in their document processing use cases.


## Document Insights with Standard Output
Standard output for documents allows you to quickly obtain insights like document summaries, descriptions, and statistics on elements, tables, figures, words, and lines. It generates the document text in various formats like plain text, HTML, and Markdown, enabling easy integration. The standard output also extracts tabular data and figures, providing the data in structured CSV format and cropped image files. This simplifies common document processing tasks and helps customers derive insights from their unstructured content without the need for custom configurations.

## Fine tune your extractions using Custom Output
If your use case requires more tailored outputs beyond what is produced by standard Output, Amazon Bedrock Data Automation provides the ability to use custom output configuration. Custom outputs are configured using `blueprints`. The blueprints allow you to specify the exact fields and data formats you need to extract from your documents, giving you full control over the output. This customization capability simplifies the integration of Bedrock Data Automation's insights into the your existing applications and workflows, enabling you to automate complex document processing tasks and deliver business value more efficiently.

## Combining Standard output and custom output with Projects
It is quite common when processing documents to have different kinds of documents as part of your use case. This means you might want to use multiple blueprints for the different kinds of documents. Projects in Amazon Bedrock Data Automation allow you to efficiently manage both standard and custom outputs when processing multiple document types. You can configure a single project with up to 40 custom blueprints, each tailored to extract specific data fields from different document types. When you pass a file containing multiple documents, Bedrock Data Automation will automatically split the file, match each document to the appropriate blueprint, and generate the custom outputs you've defined. This project-based approach simplifies the management of your document processing workflows, enabling you to derive the standardized insights as well as the custom data extractions you require, all through a unified configuration.
