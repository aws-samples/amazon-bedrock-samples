        Returns basic information about the health of the cluster.


        :arg index: Comma-separated list of data streams, indices, and
            index aliases used to limit the request. Wildcard expressions (*) are
            supported. To target all data streams and indices in a cluster, omit
            this parameter or use `_all` or `*`.
        :arg awareness_attribute: The awareness attribute for which the
            health is required.
        :arg cluster_manager_timeout: Operation timeout for connection
            to cluster-manager node.
        :arg error_trace: Whether to include the stack trace of returned
            errors.
        :arg expand_wildcards: Whether to expand wildcard expression to
            concrete indices that are open, closed or both. Valid choices are all,
            closed, hidden, none, open.
        :arg filter_path: Comma-separated list of filters used to reduce
            the response.
        :arg human: Whether to return human readable values for
            statistics.
        :arg level: Can be one of cluster, indices or shards. Controls
            the details level of the health information returned. Valid choices are
            awareness_attributes, cluster, indices, shards.
        :arg local: If true, the request retrieves information from the
            local node only. Defaults to false, which means information is retrieved
            from the master node. Default is false.
        :arg master_timeout (Deprecated: To promote inclusive language,
            use 'cluster_manager_timeout' instead.): Period to wait for a connection
            to the master node. If no response is received before the timeout
            expires, the request fails and returns an error.
        :arg pretty: Whether to pretty format the returned JSON
            response.
        :arg source: The URL-encoded request definition. Useful for
            libraries that do not accept a request body for non-POST requests.
        :arg timeout: Period to wait for a response. If no response is
            received before the timeout expires, the request fails and returns an
            error.
        :arg wait_for_active_shards: A number controlling to how many
            active shards to wait for, all to wait for all shards in the cluster to
            be active, or 0 to not wait. Valid choices are all, index-setting.
        :arg wait_for_events: Can be one of immediate, urgent, high,
            normal, low, languid. Wait until all currently queued events with the
            given priority are processed. Valid choices are high, immediate,
            languid, low, normal, urgent.
        :arg wait_for_no_initializing_shards: A boolean value which
            controls whether to wait (until the timeout provided) for the cluster to
            have no shard initializations. Defaults to false, which means it will
            not wait for initializing shards.
        :arg wait_for_no_relocating_shards: A boolean value which
            controls whether to wait (until the timeout provided) for the cluster to
            have no shard relocations. Defaults to false, which means it will not
            wait for relocating shards.
        :arg wait_for_nodes: The request waits until the specified
            number N of nodes is available. It also accepts >=N, <=N, >N and <N.
            Alternatively, it is possible to use ge(N), le(N), gt(N) and lt(N)
            notation.
        :arg wait_for_status: One of green, yellow or red. Will wait
            (until the timeout provided) until the status of the cluster changes to
            the one provided or better, i.e. green > yellow > red. By default, will
            not wait for any status. Valid choices are green, red, yellow.
