He remains a valued option for Deschamps even if he should have scored more than 14 goals in 47 caps.",

He had been overlooked by his country since 2010 and did not seem likely to get a recall under Didier Deschamps, with whom he clashed when the pair were together at Marseille. A move from Ligue 1 to the Mexican league last summer hardly made a return to Les Bleus squad more likely, but Karim Benzema's problems and Gignac's prolific club form convinced Deschamps to give him a surprising recall in March. The 30-year-old is capable of spectacular moments but has never looked consistently top-class. Now, though, the manager evidently hopes he is capable of one late, great flourish.",

The career choices were [made] in order to be able to return to the French team,\" Rami said. \"I found myself in front of the manager ... He's restored my confidence. I'm not going to say exactly what he said. But I know, and everything proves it, that the error was on my side. I've always been forthright in what I say, but that doesn't mean I have the right to make mistakes. I take responsibility for my errors.\"",
