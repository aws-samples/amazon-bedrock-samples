Perišić has been linked with a summer reunion with his former Dortmund manager Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool, despite their 2012 falling out when Perišić accused Klopp of having favourites, and Klopp told Perišić to “keep your mouth shut … If he shuts up it is better for him. Complaining in public is childish.” Klopp sold him to Wolfsburg two months later.",
