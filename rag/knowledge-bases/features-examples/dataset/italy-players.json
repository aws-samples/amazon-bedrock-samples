Made his breakthrough at Milan and for one giddy six-month spell, at the start of the 2012-13 season, he scored 10 league goals and was hailed as the future of Italian football. \"A champion's strength comes from never being contented,” he said back then but did not appear to listen to himself as he lost focus and form. He is 23 years old now - no longer a boy - and this would be the perfect summer to show the rest of Europe (and the world) what he is capable of.",
