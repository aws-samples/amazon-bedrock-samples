One of the reasons he is so mature is that the controversial 1860 Munich manager Ricardo Moniz (it is still difficult to know whether he was a genius or mad, according to the Süddeutsche) made him captain when he was 18. “He will become a man now,” said Moniz. A qualified retail salesman, he did some of his qualification in the Borussia fan shop. “I nearly sold my own shirt,” he said.",

A wonderful footballer, he told the Guardian in 2014: “I understand that many find it hard to get me as a player,” he says. “They say: ‘Impossible, how did he do that?’ But, at some point, they maybe start thinking: ‘Oh, he’s quite good after all.’”",

Has invested money in youth football in Bergheim, where he grew up, as well as helping Polish club Gornik Zabrze get a sponsorship deal with adidas. Interviews with him are often funny, although not always intentionally. Famous quotes include: “Football is like that, sometimes the better team wins” and “we have to pull up our heads now … oh as well as our sleeves.”",
