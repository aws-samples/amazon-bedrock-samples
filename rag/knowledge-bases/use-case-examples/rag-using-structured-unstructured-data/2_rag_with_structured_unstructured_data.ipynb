    "# RAG with structured and unstructed data\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage multiple data sources, including structured data from a database and unstructed data (like pdf, txt, etc.), to answer questions using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we'll show how to integrate a knowledge base and a database to retrieve relevant information and generate comprehensive natural language responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll set up a `MultiRetrievalQAChain` that can answer queries by retrieving information from an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base and a database (using Text-to-SQL as a retriever), and then generating responses using the Claude 3.0 Sonnet language model. The `MultiRetrievalQAChain` can intelligently determine the appropriate data source for a given question, fetch relevant information, maintain conversation context, and synthesize the retrieved data into a coherent natural language answer. Here's a diagram illustrating the workflow:\n",

    "![Multiple Retrievers in a QA Chain Image](./image/Text2SQL-RAG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "The `MultiRetrievalQAChain` is an advanced implementation of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based language models. By integrating multiple retrievers, each specialized in a different data source, the chain can leverage diverse information sources to generate comprehensive and accurate responses. In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to use structured data from a database (retrieved using Text-to-SQL as a retriever) as well as a text-based knowledge base to power a RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook uses a custom module designed specifically for Amazon Athena, but you can easily adapt it for other databases like Amazon Redshift and Amazon RDS by using their respective data APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook assumes that you have\n",
    "1. created a Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases using unstructred data\n",
    "2. have data available for querying via SQL in Amazon Athena.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't met the prerequisite, please follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a knowledge base and ingest your documents by following this [01_create_ingest_documents_test_kb_multi_ds.ipynb](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/blob/main/knowledge-bases/features-examples/01-rag-concepts/01_create_ingest_documents_test_kb_multi_ds.ipynb).\n",
    "2. Note down the knowledge base ID, as you'll need it later in this notebook.\n",
    "3. If you need to use synthetic data for testing, refer to this [link](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/knowledge-bases/features-examples/synthetic_dataset) to get synthetic text data that you can use to create your Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.\n",
    "4. To create synthetic structured data, you can run [0-create-dummy-structured-data.ipynb](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/knowledge-bases/use-case-examples/rag-using-structured-unstructured-data/0-create-dummy-structured-data.ipynb) notebook and then use [1_create_sql_dataset_optional.ipynb](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/knowledge-bases/use-case-examples/rag-using-structured-unstructured-data/1_create_sql_dataset_optional.ipynb) notebook to create a database and table in Amazon Athena.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The `custom_database_retriever.py` file currently uses table schema for a retail order website generated by using [0-create-dummy-structured-data.ipynb](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/knowledge-bases/use-case-examples/rag-using-structured-unstructured-data/0-create-dummy-structured-data.ipynb) notebook. If you choose to use a different dataset, please update the schema for tables and table information inside `custom_database_retriever.py` file."
