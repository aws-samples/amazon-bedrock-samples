with LangGraph on Amazon Bedrock</h2> --> <div class="admonition tip inline end"> <p class=admonition-title><a href=https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/blob/main/agents-and-function-calling/open-source-agents/langgraph/langgraph-fact-checker-feedback-loop.ipynb target=_blank>Open in github</a></p> </div> <h2>1. Introduction to feedback loops</h2> <p>This solution implements an advanced fact-checking feedback mechanism for AI-generated summaries using LangGraph on Amazon Bedrock. The process begins with an AI model summarizing a given document. The summary then undergoes an evaluation loop where individual claims are extracted and verified against the original text. If any conflicts are found, the system provides specific feedback to the AI, prompting it to revise the summary. This cycle continues for a set number of iterations or until a faithful summary is produced.</p> <p>The approach is particularly useful in scenarios where accuracy and faithfulness to source material are crucial, such as in report generation in business settings, academic research, or legal document summarization. It helps mitigate the risk of AI hallucinations or misrepresentations by implementing a self-correcting mechanism. This method not only improves the quality of AI-generated content but also provides transparency in the summarization process, which is valuable in building trust in AI systems for critical applications.</p> <p><img alt=Fact-checker-main src=../assets/Fact-checker-main.png></p> <h2>2. How fact-checking feedback loop works</h2> <p>It begins with an input document fed into a Summarizer, which produces a summary using a specific prompt. This summary then moves to the Evaluator stage, where it undergoes two steps: first, a Claim Extractor extracts key claims from the summary, and then an Evaluator prompt assesses these claims against the original document. If the evaluation determines the summary is faithful to the original content, the process concludes successfully, outputting the verified summary. </p> <p><img alt=Fact-checker-if-faithful.png src=../assets/Fact-checker-if-faithful.png></p> <p>If the Evaluator concludes that the summary is unfaithful, the flow marked in blue text in the diagram is executed. The feedback is appended to the Summarizer chat as a human message. The Summarizer then uses this feedback to generate a revised summary. The revised summary proceeds to another evaluation by the Evaluator. If it's identified as faithful, the graph execution finishes with the revised summary.</p> <p><img alt=Fact-checker-if-not-faithful.png src=../assets/Fact-checker-if-not-faithful.png></p> <p>The summarization process incorporates a feedback and evaluation loop that iterates up to a predefined number (N) of attempts. The system strives to generate a faithful summary within these iterations. If a faithful summary is achieved at any point, the process concludes successfully. However, if after N attempts a faithful summary has not been produced, the process terminates with a fail response, clearly indicating that the goal was not met. This approach prioritizes accuracy over completion, opting to acknowledge failure rather than provide an unfaithful summary. It ensures that any summary output by the system meets a high standard of faithfulness to the original document.</p> <p><img alt=Fact-checker-faithful-check-n-times.png src=../assets/Fact-checker-faithful-check-n-times.png></p> <h2>3.

<span class=n>evaluator_prompt</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=s2>&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class=s2>You are a Principal Editor at a prestigious publishing company. Your task is to evaluate whether an LLM-generated summary is faithful to the original document.</span>

<span class=s2>You will be presented with:</span>
<span class=s2>1. The original document content</span>
<span class=s2>2. Claims extracted from the LLM-generated summary</span>

<span class=s2>Instructions:</span>
<span class=s2>1. Carefully read the original document content.</span>
<span class=s2>2. Examine each extracted claim from the summary individually.</span>
<span class=s2>3. For each claim, determine if it is accurately represented in the original document. Express your thinking and reasoning.</span>
<span class=s2>4. After evaluating all claims, provide a single JSON output with the following structure (markdown json formatting: triple backticks and &quot;json&quot;):</span>
<span class=s2>```json</span>
<span class=s2>{{</span>
<span class=s2>&quot;is_faithful&quot;: boolean,</span>
<span class=s2>&quot;reason&quot;: &quot;string&quot; [Optional]</span>
<span class=s2>}}</span>
<span class=s2>`` `</span>
<span class=s2>Important notes:</span>
<span class=s2>- The &quot;is_faithful&quot; value should be true only if ALL extracted claims are accurately represented in the original document.</span>
<span class=s2>- If even one claim is not faithful to the original content, set &quot;is_faithful&quot; to false.</span>
<span class=s2>- When &quot;is_faithful&quot; is false, provide a clear explanation in the &quot;reason&quot; field, specifying which claim(s) are not faithful and why.</span>
<span class=s2>- The &quot;reason&quot; field is optional when &quot;is_faithful&quot; is true.</span>
<span class=s2>- The output should contain only one JSON output. This is how the software will parse your response. If you&#39;re responding with multiple JSON statements in your response, you&#39;re doing it wrong.</span>
<span class=s2>The original document (the source of truth):</span>

</code></pre> <h2>4. Conclusion</h2> <p>This notebook shows how to build a fact-checking system for AI summaries using LangGraph and Amazon Bedrock. It creates a loop that checks if a summary is accurate, and if not, tries to fix it. This helps make AI-generated content more reliable by catching and correcting mistakes. The system is useful for tasks where accuracy is important, like in business reports or legal documents. It demonstrates a practical way to improve AI summaries and make them more trustworthy.</p> <p>You can extend and adapt this method to your specific use cases, implementing a feedback-loop control mechanism to achieve more deterministic and trustworthy responses from LLMs</p> <h2>5.
