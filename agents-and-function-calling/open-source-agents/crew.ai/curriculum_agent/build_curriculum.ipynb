    "This notebook implements an AI-powered curriculum planning system based on Wiggins and McTighe's \n",
    "Understanding by Design (UbD) framework (Bowen, 2017). UbD employs \"backward design\" - starting with \n",

    "\n",
    "Key Benefits of Backward Design (Wiggins & McTighe, 1998):\n",
    "- Focuses on student learning outcomes rather than teaching activities\n",
    "- Encourages intentional and explicit instruction\n",
    "- Ensures activities align with learning goals\n",
    "- Promotes student understanding rather than just content coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses three stages of backward design:\n",
