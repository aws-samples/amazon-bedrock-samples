The ticket that an employee creates needs to be in the following format:

```
Title: Request Environment Access <Title that describes what the ticket is for>

EnvironmentId: 223 <EnvironmentId for which the employee has requested access>

Business Justification: Need to test new features on Quicksight Dashboard <Business justification for requesting access>

Access Duration: 8 days <Duration for which the employee needs access>

Access Type: Read <Type of access required>
```

If employee already has acesss to Environment, the ticket can be auto-resolved. 

Access Type can be one of the following values:
 i. Read
 ii. Write
 iii. Developer
 iv. Admin
 v. DevOps

Access to the employee can be auto-assigned if all the given scenarios are true:

1. The environment is owned by the manager of the employee.
2. The employee has asked for less than 30 days of access.
3. The access type is not Admin.

If all the above scenarios are not true, then the ticket should be assigned to the owner of the environment.
