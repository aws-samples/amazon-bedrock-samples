    "## Building Dynamic AI Assistants with Amazon Bedrock Inline Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll walk through the process of setting up and invoking an inline agent, showcasing its flexibility and power in creating dynamic AI assistants. By following our progressive approach, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of how to use inline agents for various use cases and complexity levels. Throughout a single interactive conversation, we will demonstrate how the agent can be enhanced `on the fly` with new tools and instructions while maintaining context of our ongoing discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow a progressive approach to building our assistant:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple Inline Agent: We'll start with a basic inline agent with a code interpreter.\n",
    "2. Adding Knowledge Bases: We'll enhance our agent by incorporating a knowledge base with role-based access.\n",
    "3. Integrating Action Groups: Finally, we'll add custom tools to extend the agent's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Inline Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Inline agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-create-inline.html) are a powerful feature of Amazon Bedrock that allow developers to create flexible and adaptable AI assistants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional static agents, inline agents can be dynamically configured at runtime, enabling real time adjustments to their behavior, capabilities, and knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of inline agents include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic configuration**: Modify the agent's instructions, action groups, and other parameters on the fly.\n",
    "2. **Flexible integration**: Easily incorporate external APIs and services as needed for each interaction.\n",
    "3. **Contextual adaptation**: Adjust the agent's responses based on user roles, preferences, or specific scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Inline Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline agents offer several advantages for building AI applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rapid prototyping**: Quickly experiment with different configurations without redeploying your application.\n",
    "2. **Personalization**: Tailor the agent's capabilities to individual users or use cases in real time.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: Efficiently manage a single agent that can adapt to multiple roles or functions.\n",
    "4. **Cost effectiveness**: Optimize resource usage by dynamically selecting only the necessary tools and knowledge for each interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, make sure that you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An active AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock.\n",
    "2. Necessary permissions to create and invoke inline agents.\n",
    "3. Be sure to complete additonal prerequisites, visit [Amazon Bedrock Inline Agent prerequisites documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inline-agent-prereq.html) to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing prerequisites\n",
    "Let's begin with installing the required packages. This step is important as you need `boto3` version `1.35.68` or later to use inline agents."

    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated the key aspects of using the Amazon Bedrock Inline Agents API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic agent invocation\n",
    "2. Incorporating knowledge bases\n",
    "3. Adding custom action groups\n",
    "4. Implementing guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these API capabilities, developers can create dynamic, adaptable AI assistants that can be easily customized for various use cases without redeploying applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "1. Inline agents offer great flexibility through their API\n",
    "2. Knowledge bases and action groups can be easily integrated\n",
    "3. Guardrails help maintain responsible AI practices"
