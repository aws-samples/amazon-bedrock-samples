# Bedrock Batch Job Orchestration

A flexible, scalable framework for orchestration of [**Bedrock Batch Inference**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference.html) via AWS Step Functions.

## Overview

For very large-scale (>>1,000 records), time-insensitive foundation model-based processing (including LLM's and embedding models), [**Bedrock Batch Inference**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference.html) is a cost-effective alternative to the on-demand Bedrock endpoints. It allows you to submit large batches of prompts/input records into asynchronous model invocation jobs, which process the requests at a 50% discount compared to on-demand. Jobs are put in a first-come-first-serve queue, and while there is no guaranteed SLA for batch jobs, they are typically returned within hours, depending on the batch size and model demand.

Batch inference makes the most sense for very large scale jobs, but it comes with a bit of overhead compared to simple InvokeModel requests to the on-demand endpoints.

**Key Challenges**

First, job inputs have to be structured in a particular way, as JSONL files with a line for each input record, matching the API request structure for that foundation model (FM) / provider. For example, [Anthropic Claude](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-anthropic-claude-messages.html) models have a different JSON structure compared to [Titan-V2 text embeddings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-embed-text.html). There are also quotas representing the minimum (currently defaults to 1,000) and maximum (50,000) number of records per batch. 

Next, orchestration of the asynchronous, long-running jobs requires clients to maintain an inventory of which individual jobs are associated to a given run. There is also a quota related to the maximum number of concurrent in-progress job executions at a given time. 

> For example, if you have a job performing sentiment analysis on 500K tweets, that means you will need to execute at least 500K / 50K => 10 individual batch inference jobs. If the quota for the maximum number of concurrent jobs is only 5, you will need to manage this capacity efficiently (and ideally, in an automated fashion).

Finally, you will likely want to perform some light post-processing on the batch outputs (another large JSONL file) in order to parse the responses and join the output back to the original input, if necessary (e.g. given some text to embed, you will need a way to link the output vector back to the original text).

**Solution**

This artifact provides a flexible and scalable framework to simplify batch orchestration. Given a simple configuration input (including the S3 URI to input files OR a Hugging Face dataset ID, model ID, and prompt ID) and the State Machine deployed in this AWS CDK Stack will handle the following:

- **Pre-Processing** of input datasets to prepare batch job inputs for your particular model ID and prompt template. The [`BaseProcessor`](lambda/processor.py) abstract class can easily be extended for any model provider, such as Llama 3 or AI21 Labs.
- **Orchestration** of batch jobs in an event-driven fashion. We maintain an internal inventory of jobs in a DynamoDB table and keep it updated when Bedrock emits events related to job status changes. These updates are then transmitted back to the step function via the ["Wait for Task Token Callback" integration pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token). Using a SFN Map, we ensure that the maximum capacity of concurrent jobs is maintained until all records have been processed.
- **Post-Processing** of batch outputs to perform some light parsing and join model responses back to the original input data.

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to deploy the CDK stack to your AWS environment.

**Prerequisites**

- `node` & `npm`
- AWS CDK (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)

1. Clone this repository into your local development environment and `cd` into this folder.

`git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples.git && cd amazon-bedrock-samples/poc-to-prod/bedrock-batch-orchestrator`

2. Install the required packages.

`npm i`

3. Check the [`prompt_templates.py`](lambda/prompt_templates.py) file and add a new prompt template to `prompt_id_to_template` for your desired use case.

`prompt_id_to_template` is a dict where the key is the `prompt_id` (allowing you to associate a given job with a particular prompt). Keep in mind that any formatting keys in the prompt string template will need to also exist in your input file. For example, given the prompt template

`Tell me a joke about {topic} in less than 50 words.`

You will need to make sure that your input dataset has a column for each formatting key (e.g. `topic` in the example above).

Note that prompt templates are not used for embedding model-based jobs.

4. Deploy the CDK stack.

`npm run cdk deploy`

Take note of the CFN Outputs denoting the names of the bucket and step function:

✨  Deployment time: 23.16s

✨  Total time: 26.74s
```

5. As your input dataset, you can either use a Hugging Face dataset ID or point directly to a dataset in S3 (CSV or parquet formats are currently supported).

**Hugging Face Dataset**

Reference a dataset ID, e.g. [`w601sxs/simpleCoT`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/w601sxs/simpleCoT), and your dataset will be pulled directly from Hugging Face Hub.

**S3 Dataset**

Upload an input CSV or parquet file to the S3 bucket and copy the S3 URI.

e.g. `aws s3 cp topics.csv s3://batch-inference-bucket-<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>/inputs/jokes/topics.csv`

6. Open up your step function in AWS Console and submit an input with the following structure. You either need to supply a `dataset_id` and `split` (for Hugging Face datasets) or an `s3_uri` (for S3 datasets):

e.g. for Anthropic Models with an S3 Input:

```json
{
  "s3_uri": "s3://batch-inference-bucket-<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>/inputs/jokes/topics.csv",
  "job_name_prefix": "test-joke-job1",
  "model_id": "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0",
  "prompt_id": "joke_about_topic"
}
```

Note that the `prompt_id` of `joke_about_topic` maps to a prompt template in [`prompt_templates.py`](lambda/prompt_templates.py) which has a formatting key for `topic`, which must be one of the columns in the input CSV file.

e.g. for a Hugging Face dataset

```json
{
  "dataset_id": "w601sxs/simpleCoT",
  "split": "train",
  "job_name_prefix": "test-cot-job-1",
  "model_id": "us.anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0",
  "prompt_id": "question_answering",
  "max_num_jobs": 1
}
```

Note that we supplied a `dataset_id` and `split` to reference. The `question_answering` prompt template in [`prompt_templates.py`](lambda/prompt_templates.py) has a formatting key called `source` to match the name of the appropriate column in the referenced [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/w601sxs/simpleCoT).

We also have optional keys for `max_num_jobs` (to limit the total number of jobs - useful for testing on a smaller scale) and `max_records_per_batch`.

To generate embeddings with a model like Titan-V2 embeddings, you do not need to provide a `prompt_id`, but you do need to ensure that your input CSV file has a column called `input_text` with the text you would like to embed.

```json
{
  "s3_uri": "s3://batch-inference-bucket-<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>/inputs/embeddings/embedding_input.csv",
  "job_name_prefix": "test-embeddings-job1",
  "model_id": "amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0",
  "prompt_id": null
}
```

**Note: Currently, the only supported models in this codebase are the Anthropic family and Titan-V2 embeddings. Extending to other providers is simply a matter of updating [`processor.py`](lambda/processor.py) with a new `BaseProcessor` class that implements the `process_input` and `process_output` functions according to the signature in the abstract method. You will also need to update the logic in `get_processor_for_model_id` to associate a given model ID with your new `BaseProcessor`.**

![Step Function Execution](static/step-function-console.png)

Monitor your step function as it runs the job(s). **The max number of submitted and in-progress jobs is controlled by a CDK context variable in [`cdk.json`](cdk.json) (key: `maxSubmittedAndInProgressJobs`)**. The paths to your resulting CSV file(s) will be aggregated in the outputs from the execution.

The output CSV file(s) will contain all the same columns as your input file.

For text-based models, the output string will be in a new column called `response`:

For embedding models, the output (list of floats) will be in a new column called `embedding`
