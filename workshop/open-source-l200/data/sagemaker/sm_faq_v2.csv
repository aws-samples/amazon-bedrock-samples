How can I check for imbalances in my model?," Amazon SageMaker Clarify Version 2 will helps improve model transparency. SageMaker Clarify checks for imbalances during data preparation, after training, and ongoing over time"
What kind of bias does SageMaker Clarify detect?," Measuring bias in ML models is a first step to mitigating bias. "
How does SageMaker Clarify improve model explainability?, "SageMaker Clarify is integrated with SageMaker Experiments to provide a feature importance graph detailing the importance of each input for your modelâ€™s overall decision-making process after the model has been trained. " 
Can i use Quantum computing?," Yes SageMaker version sometime in future will let you run quantum computing"
When should I use reinforcement learning?," While the goal of supervised learning techniques is to find the right answer based on the patterns in the training data, the goal of unsupervised learning techniques is to find similarities and differences between data points. In contrast, the goal of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is to learn how to achieve a desired outcome even when it is not clear how to accomplish that outcome. As a result, RL is more suited to enabling intelligent applications where an agent can make autonomous decisions such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, HVAC, industrial control, and more."
What type of environments can I use for training RL models?," Amazon SageMaker RL supports a number of different environments for training RL models. You can use AWS services such as AWS RoboMaker, open-source environments or custom environments developed using Open AI Gym interfaces, or commercial simulation environments such as MATLAB and SimuLink."
