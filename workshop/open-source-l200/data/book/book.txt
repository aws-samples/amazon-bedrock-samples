Great Gatsby By F. Scott Fitzgerald The Great Gatsby Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;   If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,   Till she cry ‘Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,   I must have you!’ —THOMAS PARKE D’INVILLIERS comChapter 1 In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave  me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind  ever since. ‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me,  ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had  the advantages that you’ve had.’ He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually  communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he  meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I’m in - clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up  many curious natures to me and also made me the victim  of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to  detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a  normal person, and so it came about that in college I was  unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy  to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the con - fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,  preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some  unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver - ing on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young  men or at least the terms in which they express them are  usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.  Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still  a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my fa -The Great Gatsby ther snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense  of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at  birth. And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to  the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded  on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point  I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from  the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in  uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want - ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses  into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his  name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby  who represented everything for which I have an unaffect - ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful  gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,  some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he  were related to one of those intricate machines that register  earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness  had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which  is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness  such as I have never found in any other person and which  it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned  out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what  foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily  closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short- winded elations of men. My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in  this middle-western city for three generations. The Car - comraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that  we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the ac - tual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who  came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and  started the wholesale hardware business that my father car - ries on today. I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look  like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled  painting that hangs in Father’s office. I graduated from New  Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father,  and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic mi - gration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid  so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the  warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like  the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and  learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond  business so I supposed it could support one more single  man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were  choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—ye- es’ with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance  me for a year and after various delays I came east, perma - nently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two. The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was  a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns  and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office sug - gested that we take a house together in a commuting town  it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather  beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the  last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went The Great Gatsby out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a  few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish  woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut - tered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove. It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,  more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road. ‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked helpless - ly. I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I  was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casu - ally conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood. And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves  growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I  had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over  again with the summer. There was so much to read for one thing and so much  fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giv - ing air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and  investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and  gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold  the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Mae - cenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many  other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one  year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials  for the ‘Yale News’—and now I was going to bring back all  such things into my life and become again that most limited  of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man.’ This isn’t just an  epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a  single window, after all. comIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a  house in one of the strangest communities in North Ameri - ca. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself  due east of New York and where there are, among other  natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty  miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in  contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into  the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western  Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.  They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus  story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but  their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual  confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a  more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every  particular except shape and size. I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the  two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bi - zarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My  house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the  Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented  for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right  was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imi - tation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on  one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a  marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn  and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or rather, as I didn’t  know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentle - man of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it  was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a The Great Gatsby view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and  the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dol - lars a month. Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable  East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the  summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to  have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second  cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college. And  just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago. Her husband, among various physical accomplishments,  had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played  football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of  those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at  twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-cli - max. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college  his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but  now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather  took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a  string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to real - ize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough  to do that. Why they came east I don’t know. They had spent a year  in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here  and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were  rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over  the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into  Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seek - ing a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some  irrecoverable football game. comAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I  drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarce - ly knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I  expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial man - sion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and  ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping  over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—final - ly when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright  vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front  was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with  reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon,  and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his  legs apart on the front porch. He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he  was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard  mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant  eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him  the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not  even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide  the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those  glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you  could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder  moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enor - mous leverage—a cruel body. His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the im - pression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of  paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and  there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts. ‘Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,’ The Great Gatsby 10he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a  man than you are.’ We were in the same Senior Society, and  while we were never intimate I always had the impression  that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with  some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own. We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch. ‘I’ve got a nice place here,’ he said, his eyes flashing about  restlessly. Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat  hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken  Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub- nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore. ‘It belonged to Demaine the oil man.’ He turned me  around again, politely and abruptly. ‘We’ll go inside.’ We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy- colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French  windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming  white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a  little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room,  blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags,  twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the  ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, mak - ing a shadow on it as wind does on the sea. The only completely stationary object in the room was an  enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed  up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both  in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if  they had just been blown back in after a short flight around  the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to 11 comthe whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a pic - ture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan  shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about  the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young  women ballooned slowly to the floor. The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was  extended full length at her end of the divan, completely  motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were  balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If  she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of  it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apol - ogy for having disturbed her by coming in. The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she  leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression— then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I  laughed too and came forward into the room. ‘I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.’ She laughed again, as if she said something very witty,  and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face,  promising that there was no one in the world she so much  wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a mur - mur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I’ve  heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people  lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less  charming.) At any rate Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me  almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back  again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered  a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of The Great Gatsby 1apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete  self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me ques - tions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that  the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrange - ment of notes that will never be played again. Her face was  sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a  bright passionate mouth—but there was an excitement in  her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to  forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ‘Listen,’ a prom - ise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since  and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next  hour. I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on  my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love  through me. ‘Do they miss me?’ she cried ecstatically. ‘The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear  wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there’s a per - sistent wail all night along the North Shore.’ ‘How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!’ Then  she added irrelevantly, ‘You ought to see the baby.’ ‘I’d like to.’ ‘She’s asleep. She’s two years old. Haven’t you ever seen  her?’ ‘Never.’ ‘Well, you ought to see her. She’s——‘ Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about  the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.1 com‘What you doing, Nick?’ ‘I’m a bond man.’ ‘Who with?’ I told him. ‘Never heard of them,’ he remarked decisively. This annoyed me. ‘You will,’ I answered shortly. ‘You will if you stay in the  East.’ ‘Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,’ he said, glanc - ing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for  something more. ‘I’d be a God Damned fool to live any - where else.’ At this point Miss Baker said ‘Absolutely!’ with such  suddenness that I started—it was the first word she uttered  since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as  much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid,  deft movements stood up into the room. ‘I’m stiff,’ she complained, ‘I’ve been lying on that sofa  for as long as I can remember.’ ‘Don’t look at me,’ Daisy retorted. ‘I’ve been trying to get  you to New York all afternoon.’ ‘No, thanks,’ said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in  from the pantry, ‘I’m absolutely in training.’ Her host looked at her incredulously. ‘You are!’ He took down his drink as if it were a drop in  the bottom of a glass. ‘How you ever get anything done is  beyond me.’ I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she ‘got  done.’ I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-The Great Gatsby 1breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated  by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young  cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with  polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discon - tented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a  picture of her, somewhere before. ‘You live in West Egg,’ she remarked contemptuously. ‘I  know somebody there.’ ‘I don’t know a single——‘ ‘You must know Gatsby.’ ‘Gatsby?’ demanded Daisy. ‘What Gatsby?’ Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner  was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively un - der mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as  though he were moving a checker to another square. Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips  the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored  porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered  on the table in the diminished wind. ‘Why CANDLES?’ objected Daisy, frowning. She  snapped them out with her fingers. ‘In two weeks it’ll be the  longest day in the year.’ She looked at us all radiantly. ‘Do  you always watch for the longest day of the year and then  miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and  then miss it.’ ‘We ought to plan something,’ yawned Miss Baker, sit - ting down at the table as if she were getting into bed. ‘All right,’ said Daisy. ‘What’ll we plan?’ She turned to  me helplessly. ‘What do people plan?’1 comBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed ex - pression on her little finger. ‘Look!’ she complained. ‘I hurt it.’ We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue. ‘You did it, Tom,’ she said accusingly. ‘I know you didn’t  mean to but you DID do it. That’s what I get for marrying  a brute of a man, a great big hulking physical specimen of  a——‘ ‘I hate that word hulking,’ objected Tom crossly, ‘even in  kidding.’ ‘Hulking,’ insisted Daisy. Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtru - sively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never  quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and  their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were  here—and they accepted Tom and me, making only a po - lite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They  knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later  the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was  sharply different from the West where an evening was hur - ried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually  disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of  the moment itself. ‘You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,’ I confessed on my  second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. ‘Can’t  you talk about crops or something?’ I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was  taken up in an unexpected way. ‘Civilization’s going to pieces,’ broke out Tom violently. The Great Gatsby 1‘I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you  read ‘The Rise of the Coloured Empires’ by this man God - dard?’ ‘Why, no,’ I answered, rather surprised by his tone. ‘Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The  idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be ut - terly submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.’ ‘Tom’s getting very profound,’ said Daisy with an expres - sion of unthoughtful sadness. ‘He reads deep books with  long words in them. What was that word we——‘ ‘Well, these books are all scientific,’ insisted Tom, glanc - ing at her impatiently. ‘This fellow has worked out the whole  thing. It’s up to us who are the dominant race to watch out  or these other races will have control of things.’ ‘We’ve got to beat them down,’ whispered Daisy, wink - ing ferociously toward the fervent sun. ‘You ought to live in California—’ began Miss Baker but  Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair. ‘This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are and  you are and——’ After an infinitesimal hesitation he in - cluded Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again.  ‘—and we’ve produced all the things that go to make civili - zation—oh, science and art and all that. Do you see?’ There was something pathetic in his concentration as if  his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to  him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone  rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon  the momentary interruption and leaned toward me. ‘I’ll tell you a family secret,’ she whispered enthusiasti -1 comcally. ‘It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about  the butler’s nose?’ ‘That’s why I came over tonight.’ ‘Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the sil - ver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver  service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from  morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose— —‘ ‘Things went from bad to worse,’ suggested Miss Baker. ‘Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had  to give up his position.’ For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affec - tion upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward  breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light  deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a  pleasant street at dusk. The butler came back and murmured something close to  Tom’s ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair  and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened  something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice  glowing and singing. ‘I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a— of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn’t he?’ She turned to Miss  Baker for confirmation. ‘An absolute rose?’ This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She  was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from  her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed  in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly  she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and The Great Gatsby 1went into the house. Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance conscious - ly devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat  up alertly and said ‘Sh!’ in a warning voice. A subdued im - passioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and  Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The  murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,  mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether. ‘This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor——’ I  said. ‘Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.’ ‘Is something happening?’ I inquired innocently. ‘You mean to say you don’t know?’ said Miss Baker, hon - estly surprised. ‘I thought everybody knew.’ ‘I don’t.’ ‘Why——’ she said hesitantly, ‘Tom’s got some woman  in New York.’ ‘Got some woman?’ I repeated blankly. Miss Baker nodded. ‘She might have the decency not to telephone him at din - ner-time. Don’t you think?’ Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the  flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom  and Daisy were back at the table. ‘It couldn’t be helped!’ cried Daisy with tense gayety. She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and  then at me and continued: ‘I looked outdoors for a minute  and it’s very romantic outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn  that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard 1 comor White Star Line. He’s singing away——’ her voice sang  ‘——It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?’ ‘Very romantic,’ he said, and then miserably to me: ‘If  it’s light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the  stables.’ The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook  her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact  all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments  of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being  lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look  squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn’t  guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even  Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy  skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill me - tallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the  situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct  was to telephone immediately for the police. The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.  Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between  them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a  perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly in - terested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain  of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep  gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee. Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its love - ly shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet  dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked  what I thought would be some sedative questions about her  little girl.The Great Gatsby 0‘We don’t know each other very well, Nick,’ she said  suddenly. ‘Even if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my  wedding.’ ‘I wasn’t back from the war.’ ‘That’s true.’ She hesitated. ‘Well, I’ve had a very bad  time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.’ Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say  any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the  subject of her daughter. ‘I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.’ ‘Oh, yes.’ She looked at me absently. ‘Listen, Nick; let me  tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to  hear?’ ‘Very much.’ ‘It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things.  Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows  where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned  feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a  girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away  and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl. And I hope  she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this  world, a beautiful little fool.’ ‘You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,’ she went  on in a convinced way. ‘Everybody thinks so—the most ad - vanced people. And I KNOW. I’ve been everywhere and seen  everything and done everything.’ Her eyes flashed around  her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with  thrilling scorn. ‘Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!’ The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my 1 comattention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she  had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening  had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emo - tion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she  looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if  she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished  secret society to which she and Tom belonged. Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and  Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read  aloud to him from the ‘Saturday Evening Post’—the words,  murmurous and uninflected, running together in a sooth - ing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on  the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper  as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her  arms. When we came in she held us silent for a moment with  a lifted hand. ‘To be continued,’ she said, tossing the magazine on the  table, ‘in our very next issue.’ Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her  knee, and she stood up. ‘Ten o’clock,’ she remarked, apparently finding the time  on the ceiling. ‘Time for this good girl to go to bed.’ ‘Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,’ ex - plained Daisy, ‘over at Westchester.’ ‘Oh,—you’re JORdan Baker.’ I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing con - temptuous expression had looked out at me from many  rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and The Great Gatsby Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her  too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgot - ten long ago. ‘Good night,’ she said softly. ‘Wake me at eight, won’t  you.’ ‘If you’ll get up.’ ‘I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.’ ‘Of course you will,’ confirmed Daisy. ‘In fact I think  I’ll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort  of—oh—fling you together. You know—lock you up acci - dentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat,  and all that sort of thing——‘ ‘Good night,’ called Miss Baker from the stairs. ‘I haven’t  heard a word.’ ‘She’s a nice girl,’ said Tom after a moment. ‘They oughtn’t  to let her run around the country this way.’ ‘Who oughtn’t to?’ inquired Daisy coldly. ‘Her family.’ ‘Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Be - sides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s  going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I  think the home influence will be very good for her.’ Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in si - lence. ‘Is she from New York?’ I asked quickly. ‘From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed togeth - er there. Our beautiful white——‘ ‘Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the ve - randa?’ demanded Tom suddenly. com‘Did I?’ She looked at me. ‘I can’t seem to remember, but I  think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did.  It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know——‘ ‘Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,’ he advised  me. I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few  minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door  with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light.  As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called ‘Wait! ‘I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We  heard you were engaged to a girl out West.’ ‘That’s right,’ corroborated Tom kindly. ‘We heard that  you were engaged.’ ‘It’s libel. I’m too poor.’ ‘But we heard it,’ insisted Daisy, surprising me by open - ing up again in a flower-like way. ‘We heard it from three  people so it must be true.’ Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t  even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published  the banns was one of the reasons I had come east. You can’t  stop going with an old friend on account of rumors and on  the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into  marriage. Their interest rather touched me and made them less  remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little dis - gusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for  Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but  apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for  Tom, the fact that he ‘had some woman in New York’ was The Great Gatsby really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a  book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale  ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished  his peremptory heart. Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and  in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat  out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West  Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an  abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off,  leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees  and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth  blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wa - vered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch  it I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had  emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and  was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the  silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely move - ments and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn  suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to deter - mine what share was his of our local heavens. I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him  at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I  didn’t call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he  was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward  the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I  could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced  seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green  light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of  a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had van - comished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.The Great Gatsby Chapter 2 About half way between West Egg and New York the  motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside  it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain  desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic  farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and  grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and  chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcen - dent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling  through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars  crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and  comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up  with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which  screens their obscure operations from your sight. But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust  which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment,  the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J.  Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard  high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of  enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent  nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there  to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then  sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them  and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many  paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the sol - comemn dumping ground. The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul  river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through,  the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal  scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there  of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met  Tom Buchanan’s mistress. The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he  was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he  turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her  at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he  knew. Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to  meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the  train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps  he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally  forced me from the car. ‘We’re getting off!’ he insisted. ‘I want you to meet my  girl.’ I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his  determination to have my company bordered on violence.  The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon  I had nothing better to do. I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence  and we walked back a hundred yards along the road un - der Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare. The only building  in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge  of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering  to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three  shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night The Great Gatsby restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a  garage—Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and  Sold—and I followed Tom inside. The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car vis - ible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched  in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of  a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic  apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor  himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands  on a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anae - mic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam  of hope sprang into his light blue eyes. ‘Hello, Wilson, old man,’ said Tom, slapping him jovially  on the shoulder. ‘How’s business?’ ‘I can’t complain,’ answered Wilson unconvincingly.  ‘When are you going to sell me that car?’ ‘Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.’ ‘Works pretty slow, don’t he?’ ‘No, he doesn’t,’ said Tom coldly. ‘And if you feel that way  about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.’ ‘I don’t mean that,’ explained Wilson quickly. ‘I just  meant——‘ His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around  the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a mo - ment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light  from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and  faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as  some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark  blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty  combut there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her  as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.  She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he  were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in  the eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around  spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice: ‘Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit  down.’ ‘Oh, sure,’ agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the  little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of  the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his  pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his  wife, who moved close to Tom. ‘I want to see you,’ said Tom intently. ‘Get on the next  train.’ ‘All right.’ ‘I’ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.’ She nodded and moved away from him just as George  Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door. We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was  a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny  Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the rail - road track. ‘Terrible place, isn’t it,’ said Tom, exchanging a frown  with Doctor Eckleburg. ‘Awful.’ ‘It does her good to get away.’ ‘Doesn’t her husband object?’ ‘Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New The Great Gatsby 0York. He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.’ So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up togeth - er to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson  sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to  the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the  train. She had changed her dress to a brown figured mus - lin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom  helped her to the platform in New York. At the news-stand  she bought a copy of ‘Town Tattle’ and a moving-picture  magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream  and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echo - ing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected  a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in  this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glow - ing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the  window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass. ‘I want to get one of those dogs,’ she said earnestly. ‘I  want to get one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a  dog.’ We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd re - semblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from  his neck, cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an inde - terminate breed. ‘What kind are they?’ asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he  came to the taxi-window. ‘All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?’ ‘I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose  you got that kind?’1 comThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in  his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the  neck. ‘That’s no police dog,’ said Tom. ‘No, it’s not exactly a polICE dog,’ said the man with  disappointment in his voice. ‘It’s more of an airedale.’ He  passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back. ‘Look  at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog that’ll never bother you  with catching cold.’ ‘I think it’s cute,’ said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. ‘How  much is it?’ ‘That dog?’ He looked at it admiringly. ‘That dog will cost  you ten dollars.’ The airedale—undoubtedly there was an airedale con - cerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly  white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s  lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture. ‘Is it a boy or a girl?’ she asked delicately. ‘That dog? That dog’s a boy.’ ‘It’s a bitch,’ said Tom decisively. ‘Here’s your money. Go  and buy ten more dogs with it.’ We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost  pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn’t  have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn  the corner. ‘Hold on,’ I said, ‘I have to leave you here.’ ‘No, you don’t,’ interposed Tom quickly. ‘Myrtle’ll be  hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you,  Myrtle?’The Great Gatsby ‘Come on,’ she urged. ‘I’ll telephone my sister Cathe - rine. She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought  to know.’ ‘Well, I’d like to, but——‘ We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the  West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice  in a long white cake of apartment houses. Throwing a regal  homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wil - son gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went  haughtily in. ‘I’m going to have the McKees come up,’ she announced  as we rose in the elevator. ‘And of course I got to call up my  sister, too.’ The apartment was on the top floor—a small living  room, a small dining room, a small bedroom and a bath.  The living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tap - estried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move  about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies  swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was  an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on  a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance however the hen  resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout  old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of  ‘Town Tattle ‘lay on the table together with a copy of ‘Simon  Called Peter’ and some of the small scandal magazines of  Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A  reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some  milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large  hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically  comin the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought  out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door. I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second  time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a  dim hazy cast over it although until after eight o’clock the  apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap  Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then  there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the  drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disap - peared so I sat down discreetly in the living room and read  a chapter of ‘Simon Called Peter’—either it was terrible stuff  or the whiskey distorted things because it didn’t make any  sense to me. Just as Tom and Myrtle—after the first drink Mrs. Wil - son and I called each other by our first names—reappeared,  company commenced to arrive at the apartment door. The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about  thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion  powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and  then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts  of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave  a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was  an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jin - gled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a  proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the  furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked  her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud  and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel. Mr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. The Great Gatsby He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on  his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to  everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the  ‘artistic game’ and I gathered later that he was a photogra - pher and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s  mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His  wife was shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told  me with pride that her husband had photographed her a  hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been mar - ried. Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time be - fore and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of  cream colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as  she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress  her personality had also undergone a change. The intense  vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was con - verted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures,  her assertions became more violently affected moment by  moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around  her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking  pivot through the smoky air. ‘My dear,’ she told her sister in a high mincing shout,  ‘most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think  of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my  feet and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had  my appendicitus out.’ ‘What was the name of the woman?’ asked Mrs. McKee. ‘Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet  in their own homes.’ com‘I like your dress,’ remarked Mrs. McKee, ‘I think it’s  adorable.’ Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eye - brow in disdain. ‘It’s just a crazy old thing,’ she said. ‘I just slip it on some - times when I don’t care what I look like.’ ‘But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,’  pursued Mrs. McKee. ‘If Chester could only get you in that  pose I think he could make something of it.’ We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a  strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with  a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his  head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth  slowly in front of his face. ‘I should change the light,’ he said after a moment. ‘I’d  like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try  to get hold of all the back hair.’ ‘I wouldn’t think of changing the light,’ cried Mrs. McK - ee. ‘I think it’s——‘ Her husband said ‘SH!’ and we all looked at the subject  again whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got  to his feet. ‘You McKees have something to drink,’ he said. ‘Get  some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody  goes to sleep.’ ‘I told that boy about the ice.’ Myrtle raised her eyebrows  in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. ‘These  people! You have to keep after them all the time.’ She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she The Great Gatsby flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept  into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her  orders there. ‘I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,’ asserted  Mr. McKee. Tom looked at him blankly. ‘Two of them we have framed downstairs.’ ‘Two what?’ demanded Tom. ‘Two studies. One of them I call ‘Montauk Point—the  Gulls,’ and the other I call ‘Montauk Point—the Sea.’ ‘ The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch. ‘Do you live down on Long Island, too?’ she inquired. ‘I live at West Egg.’ ‘Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago.  At a man named Gatsby’s. Do you know him?’ ‘I live next door to him.’ ‘Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wil - helm’s. That’s where all his money comes from.’ ‘Really?’ She nodded. ‘I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on  me.’ This absorbing information about my neighbor was in - terrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine: ‘Chester, I think you could do something with HER,’ she  broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and  turned his attention to Tom. ‘I’d like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the  entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start.’ com‘Ask Myrtle,’ said Tom, breaking into a short shout of  laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. ‘She’ll give you  a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?’ ‘Do what?’ she asked, startled. ‘You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your hus - band, so he can do some studies of him.’ His lips moved  silently for a moment as he invented. ‘ ‘George B. Wilson at  the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.’ Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:  ‘Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.’ ‘Can’t they?’ ‘Can’t STAND them.’ She looked at Myrtle and then at  Tom. ‘What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t  stand them? If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married  to each other right away.’ ‘Doesn’t she like Wilson either?’ The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle  who had overheard the question and it was violent and ob - scene. ‘You see?’ cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her  voice again. ‘It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart.  She’s a Catholic and they don’t believe in divorce.’ Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the  elaborateness of the lie. ‘When they do get married,’ continued Catherine,  ‘they’re going west to live for a while until it blows over.’ ‘It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.’ ‘Oh, do you like Europe?’ she exclaimed surprisingly. ‘I  just got back from Monte Carlo.’The Great Gatsby ‘Really.’ ‘Just last year. I went over there with another girl.’ ‘Stay long?’ ‘No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went  by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars  when we started but we got gypped out of it all in two days  in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I  can tell you. God, how I hated that town!’ The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a mo - ment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the  shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room. ‘I almost made a mistake, too,’ she declared vigorously. ‘I  almost married a little kyke who’d been after me for years.  I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lu - cille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester,  he’d of got me sure.’ ‘Yes, but listen,’ said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head  up and down, ‘at least you didn’t marry him.’ ‘I know I didn’t.’ ‘Well, I married him,’ said Myrtle, ambiguously. ‘And  that’s the difference between your case and mine.’ ‘Why did you, Myrtle?’ demanded Catherine. ‘Nobody  forced you to.’ Myrtle considered. ‘I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,’  she said finally. ‘I thought he knew something about breed - ing, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.’ ‘You were crazy about him for a while,’ said Catherine. ‘Crazy about him!’ cried Myrtle incredulously. ‘Who said  comI was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about  him than I was about that man there.’ She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at  me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had  played no part in her past. ‘The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew  right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best  suit to get married in and never even told me about it, and  the man came after it one day when he was out. She looked  around to see who was listening: ‘ ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I  said. ‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to  him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all af - ternoon.’ ‘She really ought to get away from him,’ resumed Cath - erine to me. ‘They’ve been living over that garage for eleven  years. And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.’ The bottle of whiskey—a second one—was now in con - stant demand by all present, excepting Catherine who ‘felt  just as good on nothing at all.’ Tom rang for the janitor  and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were  a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and  walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but  each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild stri - dent argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into  my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows  must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the  casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too,  looking up and wondering. I was within and without, si - multaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible The Great Gatsby 0variety of life. Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her  warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting  with Tom. ‘It was on the two little seats facing each other that are  always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New  York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress  suit and patent leather shoes and I couldn’t keep my eyes off  him but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be  looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came  into the station he was next to me and his white shirt-front  pressed against my arm—and so I told him I’d have to call  a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when  I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t get - ting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and  over, was ‘You can’t live forever, you can’t live forever.’ ‘ She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her  artificial laughter. ‘My dear,’ she cried, ‘I’m going to give you this dress as  soon as I’m through with it. I’ve got to get another one to - morrow. I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to  get. A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one  of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and  a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last  all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the  things I got to do.’ It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I  looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was  asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a 1 comphotograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief  I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lath - er that had worried me all the afternoon. The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind  eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning  faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go  somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each  other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward  midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to  face discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson  had any right to mention Daisy’s name. ‘Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!’ shouted Mrs. Wilson. ‘I’ll say it  whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai——‘ Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her  nose with his open hand. Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor,  and women’s voices scolding, and high over the confusion  a long broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze  and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone  half way he turned around and stared at the scene—his wife  and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled  here and there among the crowded furniture with articles  of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding flu - ently and trying to spread a copy of ‘Town Tattle’ over the  tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and  continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the chan - delier I followed. ‘Come to lunch some day,’ he suggested, as we groaned  down in the elevator.The Great Gatsby ‘Where?’ ‘Anywhere.’ ‘Keep your hands off the lever,’ snapped the elevator  boy. ‘I beg your pardon,’ said Mr. McKee with dignity, ‘I didn’t  know I was touching it.’ ‘All right,’ I agreed, ‘I’ll be glad to.’ … I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up  between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great  portfolio in his hands. ‘Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery  Horse … Brook’n Bridge ….’ Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the  Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning ‘Tribune’ and  waiting for the four o’clock train. comChapter 3 There was music from my neighbor’s house through the  summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came  and went like moths among the whisperings and the cham - pagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched  his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the  sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats  slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cat - aracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an  omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between  nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his sta - tion wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all  trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra  gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes  and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of  the night before. Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived  from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same  oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulp - less halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could  extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if  a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s  thumb. At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down  with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored The Great Gatsby lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous  garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors- d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of  harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to  a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was  set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials  so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too  young to know one from another. By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived—no thin five- piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and  saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and  high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach  now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are  parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and sa - lons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair  shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams  of Castile. The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of  cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive  with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and intro - ductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings  between women who never knew each other’s names. The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from  the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail  music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter  is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped  out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swift - ly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same  breath—already there are wanderers, confident girls who  weave here and there among the stouter and more stable,  combecome for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group  and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea- change of faces and voices and color under the constantly  changing light. Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a  cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and mov - ing her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas  platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies  his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter  as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s  understudy from the ‘Follies.’ The party has begun. I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house  I was one of the few guests who had actually been invit - ed. People were not invited—they went there. They got into  automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and some - how they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once there they were  introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that  they conducted themselves according to the rules of be - havior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they  came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for  the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket  of admission. I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of  robin’s egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morn - ing with a surprisingly formal note from his employer—the  honor would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend  his ‘little party’ that night. He had seen me several times  and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar  combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay The Great Gatsby Gatsby in a majestic hand. Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a  little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease  among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though  here and there was a face I had noticed on the commut - ing train. I was immediately struck by the number of young  Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a lit - tle hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and  prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling  something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were,  at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicin - ity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the  right key. As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host  but the two or three people of whom I asked his where - abouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so  vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk  off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in  the garden where a single man could linger without looking  purposeless and alone. I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer em - barrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and  stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little back - ward and looking with contemptuous interest down into  the garden. Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to  someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks  to the passers-by. ‘Hello!’ I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed  comunnaturally loud across the garden. ‘I thought you might be here,’ she responded absently as I  came up. ‘I remembered you lived next door to——‘ She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d  take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin  yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps. ‘Hello!’ they cried together. ‘Sorry you didn’t win.’ That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the fi - nals the week before. ‘You don’t know who we are,’ said one of the girls in yel - low, ‘but we met you here about a month ago.’ ‘You’ve dyed your hair since then,’ remarked Jordan, and  I started but the girls had moved casually on and her re - mark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like  the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s  slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps  and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated  at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with  the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced  to us as Mr. Mumble. ‘Do you come to these parties often?’ inquired Jordan of  the girl beside her. ‘The last one was the one I met you at,’ answered the girl,  in an alert, confident voice. She turned to her companion:  ‘Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?’ It was for Lucille, too. ‘I like to come,’ Lucille said. ‘I never care what I do, so  I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my  gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—The Great Gatsby inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new  evening gown in it.’ ‘Did you keep it?’ asked Jordan. ‘Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too  big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with  lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.’ ‘There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing  like that,’ said the other girl eagerly. ‘He doesn’t want any  trouble with ANYbody.’ ‘Who doesn’t?’ I inquired. ‘Gatsby. Somebody told me——‘ The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially. ‘Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.’ A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles  bent forward and listened eagerly. ‘I don’t think it’s so much THAT,’ argued Lucille skepti - cally; ‘it’s more that he was a German spy during the war.’ One of the men nodded in confirmation. ‘I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew  up with him in Germany,’ he assured us positively. ‘Oh, no,’ said the first girl, ‘it couldn’t be that, because he  was in the American army during the war.’ As our credulity  switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm.  ‘You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s look - ing at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.’ She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered.  We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimo - ny to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were  whispers about him from those who found little that it was  comnecessary to whisper about in this world. The first supper—there would be another one after mid - night—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join  her own party who were spread around a table on the other  side of the garden. There were three married couples and  Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent  innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner  or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a  greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had  preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the  function of representing the staid nobility of the country - side—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully  on guard against its spectroscopic gayety. ‘Let’s get out,’ whispered Jordan, after a somehow waste - ful and inappropriate half hour. ‘This is much too polite for  me.’ We got up, and she explained that we were going to find  the host—I had never met him, she said, and it was making  me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melan - choly way. The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby  was not there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the  steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda. On a chance we tried  an important-looking door, and walked into a high Goth - ic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably  transported complete from some ruin overseas. A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spec - tacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great  table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of The Great Gatsby 0books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and ex - amined Jordan from head to foot. ‘What do you think?’ he demanded impetuously. ‘About what?’ He waved his hand toward the book-shelves. ‘About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to as - certain. I ascertained. They’re real.’ ‘The books?’ He nodded. ‘Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought  they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re  absolutely real. Pages and—Here! Lemme show you.’ Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the  bookcases and returned with Volume One of the ‘Stoddard  Lectures.’ ‘See!’ he cried triumphantly. ‘It’s a bona fide piece of  printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco.  It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew  when to stop too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you  want? What do you expect?’ He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on  its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole  library was liable to collapse. ‘Who brought you?’ he demanded. ‘Or did you just come?  I was brought. Most people were brought.’ Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answer - ing. ‘I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,’ he con - tinued. ‘Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her 1 comsomewhere last night. I’ve been drunk for about a week now,  and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’ ‘Has it?’ ‘A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an  hour. Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re— —‘ ‘You told us.’ We shook hands with him gravely and went back out - doors. There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden,  old men pushing young girls backward in eternal grace - less circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously,  fashionably and keeping in the corners—and a great num - ber of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving  the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the  traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated  tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung  in jazz and between the numbers people were doing ‘stunts’  all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter  rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage ‘twins’—who  turned out to be the girls in yellow—did a baby act in cos - tume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than  finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the  Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the  stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn. I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table  with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave  way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laugh - ter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls The Great Gatsby of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes  into something significant, elemental and profound. At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and  smiled. ‘Your face is familiar,’ he said, politely. ‘Weren’t you in  the Third Division during the war?’ ‘Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.’ ‘I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eigh - teen. I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.’ We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little vil - lages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told  me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to  try it out in the morning. ‘Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along  the Sound.’ ‘What time?’ ‘Any time that suits you best.’ It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jor - dan looked around and smiled. ‘Having a gay time now?’ she inquired. ‘Much better.’ I turned again to my new acquaintance.  ‘This is an unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the  host. I live over there——’ I waved my hand at the invisible  hedge in the distance, ‘and this man Gatsby sent over his  chauffeur with an invitation.’ For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to under - stand. ‘I’m Gatsby,’ he said suddenly. ‘What!’ I exclaimed. ‘Oh, I beg your pardon.’ com‘I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very  good host.’ He smiled understandingly—much more than under - standingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of  eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or  five times in life. It faced—or seemed to face—the whole ex - ternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU  with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood  you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed  in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured  you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your  best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it van - ished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a  year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech  just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced  himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his  words with care. Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified him - self a butler hurried toward him with the information that  Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself  with a small bow that included each of us in turn. ‘If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,’ he urged  me. ‘Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.’ When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan— constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected  that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in  his middle years. ‘Who is he?’ I demanded. ‘Do you know?’ ‘He’s just a man named Gatsby.’The Great Gatsby ‘Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?’ ‘Now YOU’re started on the subject,’ she answered with  a wan smile. ‘Well,—he told me once he was an Oxford  man.’ A dim background started to take shape behind him but  at her next remark it faded away. ‘However, I don’t believe it.’ ‘Why not?’ ‘I don’t know,’ she insisted, ‘I just don’t think he went  there.’ Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s ‘I  think he killed a man,’ and had the effect of stimulating my  curiosity. I would have accepted without question the infor - mation that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana  or from the lower East Side of New York. That was compre - hensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial  inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of no - where and buy a palace on Long Island Sound. ‘Anyhow he gives large parties,’ said Jordan, changing  the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. ‘And I  like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there  isn’t any privacy.’ There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the  orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of  the garden. ‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ he cried. ‘At the request of Mr.  Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff’s  latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie  Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was  coma big sensation.’ He smiled with jovial condescension and  added ‘Some sensation!’ whereupon everybody laughed. ‘The piece is known,’ he concluded lustily, ‘as ‘Vladimir  Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World.’ ‘ The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, be - cause just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone  on the marble steps and looking from one group to another  with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractive - ly tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it  were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about  him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped  to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he  grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When  the ‘Jazz History of the World’ was over girls were putting  their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial  way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s  arms, even into groups knowing that some one would ar - rest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby  and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder and no sing - ing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link. ‘I beg your pardon.’ Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us. ‘Miss Baker?’ he inquired. ‘I beg your pardon but Mr.  Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.’ ‘With me?’ she exclaimed in surprise. ‘Yes, madame.’ She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in aston - ishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed  that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports The Great Gatsby clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if  she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean,  crisp mornings. I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused  and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-win - dowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s  undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical con - versation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to  join him, I went inside. The large room was full of people. One of the girls in  yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall,  red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in  song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during  the course of her song she had decided ineptly that every - thing was very very sad—she was not only singing, she was  weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she  filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyr - ic again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down  her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into  contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an  inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black  rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the  notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank  into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep. ‘She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,’  explained a girl at my elbow. I looked around. Most of the remaining women were  now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even  Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asun - comder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious  intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempt - ing to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent  way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at  intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry  diamond, and hissed ‘You promised!’ into his ear. The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward  men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably so - ber men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were  sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices. ‘Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to  go home.’ ‘Never heard anything so selfish in my life.’ ‘We’re always the first ones to leave.’ ‘So are we.’ ‘Well, we’re almost the last tonight,’ said one of the men  sheepishly. ‘The orchestra left half an hour ago.’ In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence  was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short strug - gle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night. As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library  opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.  He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his  manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people  approached him to say goodbye. Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the  porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands. ‘I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,’ she whispered.  ‘How long were we in there?’The Great Gatsby ‘Why,—about an hour.’ ‘It was—simply amazing,’ she repeated abstractedly. ‘But  I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.’ She  yawned gracefully in my face. ‘Please come and see me….  Phone book…. Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney How - ard…. My aunt….’ She was hurrying off as she talked—her  brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her  party at the door. Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed  so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests who were clus - tered around him. I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for  him early in the evening and to apologize for not having  known him in the garden. ‘Don’t mention it,’ he enjoined me eagerly. ‘Don’t give it  another thought, old sport.’ The familiar expression held no  more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed  my shoulder. ‘And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydro - plane tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.’ Then the butler, behind his shoulder: ‘Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.’ ‘All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there….  good night.’ ‘Good night.’ ‘Good night.’ He smiled—and suddenly there seemed  to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last  to go, as if he had desired it all the time. ‘Good night, old  sport…. Good night.’ But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was  not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights  comilluminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch be - side the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel,  rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two  minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the de - tachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable  attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as  they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant  din from those in the rear had been audible for some time  and added to the already violent confusion of the scene. A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck  and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the  car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleas - ant, puzzled way. ‘See!’ he explained. ‘It went in the ditch.’ The fact was infinitely astonishing to him—and I rec - ognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the  man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library. ‘How’d it happen?’ He shrugged his shoulders. ‘I know nothing whatever about mechanics,’ he said de - cisively. ‘But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?’ ‘Don’t ask me,’ said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the  whole matter. ‘I know very little about driving—next to  nothing. It happened, and that’s all I know.’ ‘Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving  at night.’ ‘But I wasn’t even trying,’ he explained indignantly, ‘I  wasn’t even trying.’The Great Gatsby 0An awed hush fell upon the bystanders. ‘Do you want to commit suicide?’ ‘You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not  even TRYing!’ ‘You don’t understand,’ explained the criminal. ‘I wasn’t  driving. There’s another man in the car.’ The shock that followed this declaration found voice in  a sustained ‘Ah-h-h!’ as the door of the coupé swung slowly  open. The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back in - voluntarily and when the door had opened wide there was  a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale  dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tenta - tively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe. Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by  the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood  swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the  duster. ‘Wha’s matter?’ he inquired calmly. ‘Did we run outa  gas?’ ‘Look!’ Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he  stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though  he suspected that it had dropped from the sky. ‘It came off,’ some one explained. He nodded. ‘At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.’ A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening  his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice: ‘Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?’1 comAt least a dozen men, some of them little better off than  he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer  joined by any physical bond. ‘Back out,’ he suggested after a moment. ‘Put her in re - verse.’ ‘But the WHEEL’S off!’ He hesitated. ‘No harm in trying,’ he said. The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I  turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced  back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s  house, making the night fine as before and surviving the  laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sud - den emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and  the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the fig - ure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a  formal gesture of farewell. Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given  the impression that the events of three nights several weeks  apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary they were  merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much  later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal af - fairs. Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun  threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white  chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the  other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names  and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on  little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even The Great Gatsby had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and  worked in the accounting department, but her brother be - gan throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went  on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away. I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason  it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went up - stairs to the library and studied investments and securities  for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters  around but they never came into the library so it was a good  place to work. After that, if the night was mellow I strolled  down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and  over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station. I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of  it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of  men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I  liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic wom - en from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was  going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know  or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to  their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they  turned and smiled back at me before they faded through  a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropoli - tan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and  felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of  windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant  dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poi - gnant moments of night and life. Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the For - ties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the  comtheatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned  together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and  there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted ciga - rettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining  that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their  intimate excitement, I wished them well. For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in mid - summer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go  places with her because she was a golf champion and ev - ery one knew her name. Then it was something more. I  wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.  The bored haughty face that she turned to the world con - cealed something—most affectations conceal something  eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and  one day I found what it was. When we were on a house- party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out  in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and  suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded  me that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament  there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a sug - gestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the  semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of  a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his statement  and the only other witness admitted that he might have  been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained  together in my mind. Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men  and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane  where any divergence from a code would be thought impos -The Great Gatsby sible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn’t able to endure  being at a disadvantage, and given this unwillingness I sup - pose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was  very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned  to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty  body. It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is  a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and  then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a  curious conversation about driving a car. It started because  she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked  a button on one man’s coat. ‘You’re a rotten driver,’ I protested. ‘Either you ought to  be more careful or you oughtn’t to drive at all.’ ‘I am careful.’ ‘No, you’re not.’ ‘Well, other people are,’ she said lightly. ‘What’s that got to do with it?’ ‘They’ll keep out of my way,’ she insisted. ‘It takes two to  make an accident.’ ‘Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.’ ‘I hope I never will,’ she answered. ‘I hate careless people.  That’s why I like you.’ Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but  she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment  I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of  interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew  that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle  back home. I’d been writing letters once a week and signing  comthem: ‘Love, Nick,’ and all I could think of was how, when  that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspi - ration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a  vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off be - fore I was free. Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal  virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people  that I have ever known.The Great Gatsby Chapter 4 On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the vil - lages along shore the world and its mistress returned  to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn. ‘He’s a bootlegger,’ said the young ladies, moving some - where between his cocktails and his flowers. ‘One time he  killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von  Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a  rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crys - tal glass.’ Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table  the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that sum - mer. It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds  and headed ‘This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.’ But I  can still read the grey names and they will give you a bet - ter impression than my generalities of those who accepted  Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of  knowing nothing whatever about him. From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the  Leeches and a man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and  Doctor Webster Civet who was drowned last summer up in  Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires and a  whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a cor - ner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came  near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert  comAuerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose  hair they say turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for  no good reason at all. Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He  came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight  with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out  on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraed - ers and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia and the  Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days  before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the grav - el drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his  right hand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who  was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammer - heads and Beluga the tobacco importer and Beluga’s girls. From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and  Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state sena - tor and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence  and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the  son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in  one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and  G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward  strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there,  and Ed Legros and James B. (“Rot-Gut’) Ferret and the De  Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble and when Fer - ret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out  and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably  next day. A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so  long that he became known as ‘the boarder’—I doubt if The Great Gatsby he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were  Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Meyer and  George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York  were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennick - ers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers  and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the  Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry  L. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a sub - way train in Times Square. Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They  were never quite the same ones in physical person but  they were so identical one with another that it inevitably  seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their  names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria or  Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodi - ous names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the  great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they  would confess themselves to be. In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina  O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls  and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and  Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita  Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American  Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her  chauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke  and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten. All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer. At nine o’clock, one morning late in July Gatsby’s gor - geous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave  comout a burst of melody from its three noted horn. It was the  first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of  his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent  invitation, made frequent use of his beach. ‘Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me  today and I thought we’d ride up together.’ He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car  with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly  American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lift - ing work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the  formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality  was continually breaking through his punctilious manner  in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there  was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient open - ing and closing of a hand. He saw me looking with admiration at his car. ‘It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport.’ He jumped off to give me a  better view. ‘Haven’t you ever seen it before?’ I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream  color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its mon - strous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes  and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields  that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many lay - ers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started  to town. I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the  past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had  little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person  of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and The Great Gatsby 0he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road - house next door. And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t  reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his  elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indeci - sively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit. ‘Look here, old sport,’ he broke out surprisingly. ‘What’s  your opinion of me, anyhow?’ A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions  which that question deserves. ‘Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,’  he interrupted. ‘I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me  from all these stories you hear.’ So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored  conversation in his halls. ‘I’ll tell you God’s truth.’ His right hand suddenly or - dered divine retribution to stand by. ‘I am the son of some  wealthy people in the middle-west—all dead now. I was  brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all  my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is  a family tradition.’ He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker  had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase ‘educated  at Oxford,’ or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had  bothered him before. And with this doubt his whole state - ment fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn’t something  a little sinister about him after all. ‘What part of the middle-west?’ I inquired casually. ‘San Francisco.’1 com‘I see.’ ‘My family all died and I came into a good deal of mon - ey.’ His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sud - den extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment  I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him  convinced me otherwise. ‘After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals  of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly  rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself  only, and trying to forget something very sad that had hap - pened to me long ago.’ With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous  laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that  they evoked no image except that of a turbaned ‘character’  leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through  the Bois de Boulogne. ‘Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and  I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchant - ed life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it  began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun de - tachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on  either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance. We  stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty  men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came  up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions  among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major and  every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Mon - tenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!’The Great Gatsby Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded  at them—with his smile. The smile comprehended Monte - negro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave  struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully  the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this  tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. My increduli - ty was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming  hastily through a dozen magazines. He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a  ribbon, fell into my palm. ‘That’s the one from Montenegro.’ To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. Orderi di Danilo , ran the circular legend, Montenegro,  Nicolas Rex . ‘Turn it.’ Major Jay Gatsby , I read, For Valour Extraordinary . ‘Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Ox - ford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left  is now the Earl of Dorcaster.’ It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers  loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of  spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, young - er—with a cricket bat in his hand. Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in  his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of  rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnaw - ings of his broken heart. ‘I’m going to make a big request of you today,’ he said,  pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, ‘so I thought you  comought to know something about me. I didn’t want you to  think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find my - self among strangers because I drift here and there trying  to forget the sad thing that happened to me.’ He hesitated.  ‘You’ll hear about it this afternoon.’ ‘At lunch?’ ‘No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re  taking Miss Baker to tea.’ ‘Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?’ ‘No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly con - sented to speak to you about this matter.’ I hadn’t the faintest idea what ‘this matter’ was, but I was  more annoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea  in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request  would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I  was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn. He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on  him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where  there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and  sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted  saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley  of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse  of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting  vitality as we went by. With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through  half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars  of the elevated I heard the familiar ‘jug—jug—SPAT!’ of a  motor cycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside. ‘All right, old sport,’ called Gatsby. We slowed down. The Great Gatsby Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the  man’s eyes. ‘Right you are,’ agreed the policeman, tipping his cap.  ‘Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!’ ‘What was that?’ I inquired. ‘The picture of Oxford?’ ‘I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he  sends me a Christmas card every year.’ Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the  girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars,  with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and  sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory mon - ey. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the  city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the  mystery and the beauty in the world. A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms,  followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more  cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us  with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern  Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid  car was included in their somber holiday. As we crossed  Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white  chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks  and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs  rolled toward us in haughty rivalry. ‘Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this  bridge,’ I thought; ‘anything at all….’ Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular won - der. Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cel - comlar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of  the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the  anteroom, talking to another man. ‘Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.’ A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regard - ed me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in  either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in  the half darkness. ‘—so I took one look at him—’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, shak - ing my hand earnestly, ‘—and what do you think I did?’ ‘What?’ I inquired politely. But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped  my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose. ‘I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, ‘All right,  Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’  He shut it then and there.’ Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward  into the restaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a  new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambu - latory abstraction. ‘Highballs?’ asked the head waiter. ‘This is a nice restaurant here,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem look - ing at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. ‘But I like  across the street better!’ ‘Yes, highballs,’ agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolf - shiem: ‘It’s too hot over there.’ ‘Hot and small—yes,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, ‘but full of  memories.’ ‘What place is that?’ I asked.The Great Gatsby ‘The old Metropole. ‘The old Metropole,’ brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily.  ‘Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone  now forever. I can’t forget so long as I live the night they  shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table and  Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was al - most morning the waiter came up to him with a funny  look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘All  right,’ says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down  in his chair. ’ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy,  but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’ ‘It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of  raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.’ ‘Did he go?’ I asked innocently. ‘Sure he went,’—Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me in - dignantly—‘He turned around in the door and says, ‘Don’t  let that waiter take away my coffee!’ Then he went out on  the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly  and drove away.’ ‘Four of them were electrocuted,’ I said, remembering. ‘Five with Becker.’ His nostrils turned to me in an in - terested way. ‘I understand you’re looking for a business  gonnegtion.’ The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling.  Gatsby answered for me: ‘Oh, no,’ he exclaimed, ‘this isn’t the man!’ ‘No?’ Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed. ‘This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some  comother time.’ ‘I beg your pardon,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, ‘I had a wrong  man.’ A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forget - ting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole,  began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile,  roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the  arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think  that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short  glance beneath our own table. ‘Look here, old sport,’ said Gatsby, leaning toward me,  ‘I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the  car.’ There was the smile again, but this time I held out against  it. ‘I don’t like mysteries,’ I answered. ‘And I don’t under - stand why you won’t come out frankly and tell me what you  want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?’ ‘Oh, it’s nothing underhand,’ he assured me. ‘Miss Bak - er’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do  anything that wasn’t all right.’ Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried  from the room leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table. ‘He has to telephone,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him  with his eyes. ‘Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and  a perfect gentleman.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘He’s an Oggsford man.’ ‘Oh!’The Great Gatsby ‘He went to Oggsford College in England. You know  Oggsford College?’ ‘I’ve heard of it.’ ‘It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.’ ‘Have you known Gatsby for a long time?’ I inquired. ‘Several years,’ he answered in a gratified way. ‘I made  the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I  knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked  with him an hour. I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man  you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and  sister.’ ‘ He paused. ‘I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.’ I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were  composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory. ‘Finest specimens of human molars,’ he informed me. ‘Well!’ I inspected them. ‘That’s a very interesting idea.’ ‘Yeah.’ He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. ‘Yeah,  Gatsby’s very careful about women. He would never so  much as look at a friend’s wife.’ When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the  table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a  jerk and got to his feet. ‘I have enjoyed my lunch,’ he said, ‘and I’m going to run  off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.’ ‘Don’t hurry, Meyer,’ said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.  Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction. ‘You’re very polite but I belong to another generation,’ he  announced solemnly. ‘You sit here and discuss your sports  and your young ladies and your——’ He supplied an imagi - nary noun with another wave of his hand—‘As for me, I am  comfifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any lon - ger.’ As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was  trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him. ‘He becomes very sentimental sometimes,’ explained  Gatsby. ‘This is one of his sentimental days. He’s quite a  character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.’ ‘Who is he anyhow—an actor?’ ‘No.’ ‘A dentist?’ ‘Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.’ Gatsby hesitated,  then added coolly: ‘He’s the man who fixed the World’s Se - ries back in 1919.’ ‘Fixed the World’s Series?’ I repeated. The idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the  World’s Series had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought  of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that mere - ly HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain. It never  occurred to me that one man could start to play with the  faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of  a burglar blowing a safe. ‘How did he happen to do that?’ I asked after a minute. ‘He just saw the opportunity.’ ‘Why isn’t he in jail?’ ‘They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.’ I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my  change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded  room. ‘Come along with me for a minute,’ I said. ‘I’ve got to say The Great Gatsby 0hello to someone.’ When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen  steps in our direction. ‘Where’ve you been?’ he demanded eagerly. ‘Daisy’s furi - ous because you haven’t called up.’ ‘This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.’ They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look  of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face. ‘How’ve you been, anyhow?’ demanded Tom of me.  ‘How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?’ ‘I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.’ I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there. One October day in nineteen-seventeen—— (said Jordan  Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight  chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel) —I was walk - ing along from one place to another half on the sidewalks  and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I  had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles  that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also  that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened  the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses  stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disap - proving way. The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns  belonged to Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two  years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the  young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a  little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang  in her house and excited young officers from Camp Tay -1 comlor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night,  ‘anyways, for an hour!’ When I came opposite her house that morning her white  roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a  lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed  in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet  away. ‘Hello Jordan,’ she called unexpectedly. ‘Please come  here.’ I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because  of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I  was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well,  then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day? The  officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way  that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and  because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the  incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn’t  lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met  him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man. That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a  few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so  I didn’t see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly old - er crowd—when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors  were circulating about her—how her mother had found her  packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say  goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effec - tually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her  family for several weeks. After that she didn’t play around  with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, The Great Gatsby short-sighted young men in town who couldn’t get into the  army at all. By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She  had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was  presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June  she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp  and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He  came down with a hundred people in four private cars and  hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before  the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three  hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour be - fore the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as  lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk  as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a  letter in the other. ’ ‘Gratulate me,’ she muttered. ‘Never had a drink before  but oh, how I do enjoy it.’ ‘What’s the matter, Daisy?’ I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that  before. ‘Here, dearis.’ She groped around in a waste-basket she  had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.  ‘Take ‘em downstairs and give ‘em back to whoever they  belong to. Tell ‘em all Daisy’s change’ her mine. Say ‘Daisy’s  change’ her mine!’.’ She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and  found her mother’s maid and we locked the door and got  her into a cold bath. She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She  comtook it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet  ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw  that it was coming to pieces like snow. But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of  ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back  into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of  the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident  was over. Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchan - an without so much as a shiver and started off on a three  months’ trip to the South Seas. I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and  I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband.  If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily  and say ‘Where’s Tom gone?’ and wear the most abstract - ed expression until she saw him coming in the door. She  used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour  rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with  unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them togeth - er—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was  in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into  a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front  wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the pa - pers too because her arm was broken—she was one of the  chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel. The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to  France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later  in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle  down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They  moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and The Great Gatsby wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.  Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantage not  to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your  tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregulari - ty of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they  don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at  all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers…. Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for  the first time in years. It was when I asked you—do you re - member?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had  gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and  said ‘What Gatsby?’ and when I described him—I was half  asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the  man she used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected  this Gatsby with the officer in her white car. When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had  left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria  through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the  tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and  the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the  grass, rose through the hot twilight: ‘I’m the Sheik of Araby,   Your love belongs to me.   At night when you’re are asleep,   Into your tent I’ll creep——’  ‘It was a strange coincidence,’ I said. ‘But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.’ com‘Why not?’ ‘Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just  across the bay.’ Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had  aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered  suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor. ‘He wants to know—’ continued Jordan ‘—if you’ll in - vite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him  come over.’ The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited  five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed star - light to casual moths so that he could ‘come over’ some  afternoon to a stranger’s garden. ‘Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a  little thing?’ ‘He’s afraid. He’s waited so long. He thought you might  be offended. You see he’s a regular tough underneath it all.’ Something worried me. ‘Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?’ ‘He wants her to see his house,’ she explained. ‘And your  house is right next door.’ ‘Oh!’ ‘I think he half expected her to wander into one of his  parties, some night,’ went on Jordan, ‘but she never did.  Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and  I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me  at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way  he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a  luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:The Great Gatsby ’ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept say - ing. ‘I want to see her right next door.’ ‘When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s he  started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very  much about Tom, though he says he’s read a Chicago paper  for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s  name.’ It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge  I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew  her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t  thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean,  hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and  who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A  phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excite - ment: ‘There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy  and the tired.’ ‘And Daisy ought to have something in her life,’ mur - mured Jordan to me. ‘Does she want to see Gatsby?’ ‘She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to  know. You’re just supposed to invite her to tea.’ We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade  of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed  down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I  had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark  cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside  me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled  and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face. comChapter 5 When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid  for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o’clock  and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light  which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongat - ing glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw  that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar. At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that  had resolved itself into ‘hide-and-go-seek’ or ‘sardines-in- the-box’ with all the house thrown open to the game. But  there wasn’t a sound. Only wind in the trees which blew the  wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house  had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I  saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn. ‘Your place looks like the world’s fair,’ I said. ‘Does it?’ He turned his eyes toward it absently. ‘I have  been glancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Is - land, old sport. In my car.’ ‘It’s too late.’ ‘Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I  haven’t made use of it all summer.’ ‘I’ve got to go to bed.’ ‘All right.’ He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness. ‘I talked with Miss Baker,’ I said after a moment. ‘I’m go -The Great Gatsby ing to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to  tea.’ ‘Oh, that’s all right,’ he said carelessly. ‘I don’t want to put  you to any trouble.’ ‘What day would suit you?’ ‘What day would suit YOU?’ he corrected me quickly. ‘I  don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.’ ‘How about the day after tomorrow?’ He considered for a  moment. Then, with reluctance: ‘I want to get the grass cut,’ he said. We both looked at the grass—there was a sharp line  where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept ex - panse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass. ‘There’s another little thing,’ he said uncertainly, and  hesitated. ‘Would you rather put it off for a few days?’ I asked. ‘Oh, it isn’t about that. At least——’ He fumbled with a  series of beginnings. ‘Why, I thought—why, look here, old  sport, you don’t make much money, do you?’ ‘Not very much.’ This seemed to reassure him and he continued more  confidently. ‘I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see,  I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline,  you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very  much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?’ ‘Trying to.’ ‘Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much  of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It  comhappens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.’ I realize now that under different circumstances that  conversation might have been one of the crises of my life.  But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a ser - vice to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off   there. ‘I’ve got my hands full,’ I said. ‘I’m much obliged but I  couldn’t take on any more work.’ ‘You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.’  Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the ‘gon - negtion’ mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was  wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a con - versation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he  went unwillingly home. The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I  think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door.  So I didn’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Is - land or for how many hours he ‘glanced into rooms’ while  his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the of - fice next morning and invited her to come to tea. ‘Don’t bring Tom,’ I warned her. ‘What?’ ‘Don’t bring Tom.’ ‘Who is ‘Tom’?’ she asked innocently. The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock  a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my  front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to  cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell  my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to The Great Gatsby 0search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy  some cups and lemons and flowers. The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a green - house arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles  to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously,  and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-col - ored tie hurried in. He was pale and there were dark signs of  sleeplessness beneath his eyes. ‘Is everything all right?’ he asked immediately. ‘The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.’ ‘What grass?’ he inquired blankly. ‘Oh, the grass in the  yard.’ He looked out the window at it, but judging from his  expression I don’t believe he saw a thing. ‘Looks very good,’ he remarked vaguely. ‘One of the  papers said they thought the rain would stop about four.  I think it was ‘The Journal.’ Have you got everything you  need in the shape of—of tea?’ I took him into the pantry where he looked a little re - proachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve  lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop. ‘Will they do?’ I asked. ‘Of course, of course! They’re fine!’ and he added hol - lowly, ‘…old sport.’ The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist  through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby  looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s ‘Econom - ics,’ starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen  floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to  time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were 1 comtaking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me in  an uncertain voice that he was going home. ‘Why’s that?’ ‘Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!’ He looked at his  watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time  elsewhere. ‘I can’t wait all day.’ ‘Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.’ He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and si - multaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into  my lane. We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself,  I went out into the yard. Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was  coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped side - ways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at  me with a bright ecstatic smile. ‘Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?’ The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in  the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and  down, with my ear alone before any words came through. A  damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her  cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took  it to help her from the car. ‘Are you in love with me,’ she said low in my ear. ‘Or why  did I have to come alone?’ ‘That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur  to go far away and spend an hour.’ ‘Come back in an hour, Ferdie.’ Then in a grave murmur,  ‘His name is Ferdie.’ ‘Does the gasoline affect his nose?’The Great Gatsby ‘I don’t think so,’ she said innocently. ‘Why?’ We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living  room was deserted. ‘Well, that’s funny!’ I exclaimed. ‘What’s funny?’ She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knock - ing at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale  as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat  pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragi - cally into my eyes. With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me  into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and dis - appeared into the living room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware  of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to  against the increasing rain. For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the  living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a  laugh followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note. ‘I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.’ A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the  hall so I went into the room. Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining  against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect  ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it  rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and  from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy  who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff  chair. ‘We’ve met before,’ muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced  commomentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive  attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to  tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he  turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back  in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of  the sofa and his chin in his hand. ‘I’m sorry about the clock,’ he said. My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I  couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thou - sand in my head. ‘It’s an old clock,’ I told them idiotically. I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed  in pieces on the floor. ‘We haven’t met for many years,’ said Daisy, her voice as  matter-of-fact as it could ever be. ‘Five years next November.’ The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back  at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with  the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the  kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray. Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a cer - tain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself  into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked consci - entiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy  eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself I made an  excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet. ‘Where are you going?’ demanded Gatsby in immediate  alarm. ‘I’ll be back.’The Great Gatsby ‘I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.’ He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door  and whispered: ‘Oh, God!’ in a miserable way. ‘What’s the matter?’ ‘This is a terrible mistake,’ he said, shaking his head from  side to side, ‘a terrible, terrible mistake.’ ‘You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,’ and luckily I added:  ‘Daisy’s embarrassed too.’ ‘She’s embarrassed?’ he repeated incredulously. ‘Just as much as you are.’ ‘Don’t talk so loud.’ ‘You’re acting like a little boy,’ I broke out impatiently.  ‘Not only that but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all  alone.’ He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with  unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously  went back into the other room. I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he  had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour be - fore—and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed  leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was  pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s  gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehis - toric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under  the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it,  like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer  had built it early in the ‘period’ craze, a decade before, and  there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes  on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have  comtheir roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took  the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into  an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the  black wreath still on the door. Americans, while occasion - ally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about  being peasantry. After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer’s  automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material  for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoon - ful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house,  appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large  central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I  went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the  murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and  the, with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that  silence had fallen within the house too. I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitch - en short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they  heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch  looking at each other as if some question had been asked  or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was  gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears and when I came  in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her hand - kerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby  that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without  a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated  from him and filled the little room. ‘Oh, hello, old sport,’ he said, as if he hadn’t seen me  for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake The Great Gatsby hands. ‘It’s stopped raining.’ ‘Has it?’ When he realized what I was talking about, that  there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled  like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light,  and repeated the news to Daisy. ‘What do you think of that?  It’s stopped raining.’ ‘I’m glad, Jay.’ Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty,  told only of her unexpected joy. ‘I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,’ he said,  ‘I’d like to show her around.’ ‘You’re sure you want me to come?’ ‘Absolutely, old sport.’ Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought  with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited  on the lawn. ‘My house looks well, doesn’t it?’ he demanded. ‘See how  the whole front of it catches the light.’ I agreed that it was splendid. ‘Yes.’ His eyes went over it, every arched door and square  tower. ‘It took me just three years to earn the money that  bought it.’ ‘I thought you inherited your money.’ ‘I did, old sport,’ he said automatically, ‘but I lost most of  it in the big panic—the panic of the war.’ I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I  asked him what business he was in he answered ‘That’s my  affair,’ before he realized that it wasn’t the appropriate re - ply. com‘Oh, I’ve been in several things,’ he corrected himself. ‘I  was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business.  But I’m not in either one now.’ He looked at me with more  attention. ‘Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I  proposed the other night?’ Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and  two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sun - light. ‘That huge place THERE?’ she cried pointing. ‘Do you like it?’ ‘I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.’ ‘I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day.  People who do interesting things. Celebrated people.’ Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went  down the road and entered by the big postern. With en - chanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the  feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the  sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn  and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at- the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find  no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no  sound but bird voices in the trees. And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette  music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were  guests concealed behind every couch and table, under or - ders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through.  As Gatsby closed the door of ‘the Merton College Library’  I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into  ghostly laughter.The Great Gatsby We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in  rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through  dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunk - en baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled  man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It  was Mr. Klipspringer, the ‘boarder.’ I had seen him wander - ing hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came  to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an  Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some  Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall. He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he  revalued everything in his house according to the measure  of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes,  too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as  though in her actual and astounding presence none of it  was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight  of stairs. His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where  the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold.  Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair,  whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began  to laugh. ‘It’s the funniest thing, old sport,’ he said hilariously. ‘I  can’t—when I try to——‘ He had passed visibly through two states and was en - tering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his  unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her pres - ence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right  through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at  coman inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he  was running down like an overwound clock. Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two  hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and  dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in  stacks a dozen high. ‘I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends  over a selection of things at the beginning of each season,  spring and fall.’ He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one  by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine  flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the ta - ble in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought  more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with  stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and  lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue.  Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into  the shirts and began to cry stormily. ‘They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muf - fled in the thick folds. ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never  seen such—such beautiful shirts before.’ After the house, we were to see the grounds and the  swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer  flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again  so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of  the Sound. ‘If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across  the bay,’ said Gatsby. ‘You always have a green light that  burns all night at the end of your dock.’The Great Gatsby 100Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed  absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred  to him that the colossal significance of that light had now  vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had  separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her,  almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the  moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count  of enchanted objects had diminished by one. I began to walk about the room, examining various in - definite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of  an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on  the wall over his desk. ‘Who’s this?’ ‘That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.’ The name sounded faintly familiar. ‘He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.’ There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting cos - tume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back  defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen. ‘I adore it!’ exclaimed Daisy. ‘The pompadour! You never  told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.’ ‘Look at this,’ said Gatsby quickly. ‘Here’s a lot of clip - pings—about you.’ They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask  to see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took up  the receiver. ‘Yes…. Well, I can’t talk now…. I can’t talk now, old  sport…. I said a SMALL town…. He must know what a  small town is…. Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea 101 comof a small town….’ He rang off. ‘Come here QUICK!’ cried Daisy at the window. The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in  the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy  clouds above the sea. ‘Look at that,’ she whispered, and then after a moment:  ‘I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it  and push you around.’ I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps  my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone. ‘I know what we’ll do,’ said Gatsby, ‘we’ll have Klip - springer play the piano.’ He went out of the room calling ‘Ewing!’ and returned  in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slight - ly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty  blonde hair. He was now decently clothed in a ‘sport shirt’  open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous  hue. ‘Did we interrupt your exercises?’ inquired Daisy polite - ly. ‘I was asleep,’ cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of em - barrassment. ‘That is, I’d BEEN asleep. Then I got up….’ ‘Klipspringer plays the piano,’ said Gatsby, cutting him  off. ‘Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?’ ‘I don’t play well. I don’t—I hardly play at all. I’m all out  of prac——‘ ‘We’ll go downstairs,’ interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a  switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed The Great Gatsby 10full of light. In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp  beside the piano. He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling  match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the  room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor  bounced in from the hall. When Klipspringer had played ‘The Love Nest’ he turned  around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in  the gloom. ‘I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play.  I’m all out of prac——‘ ‘Don’t talk so much, old sport,’ commanded Gatsby.  ‘Play!’ IN THE MORNING,   IN THE EVENING,   AIN’T WE GOT FUN——  Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow  of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on  in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were  plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the  hour of a profound human change, and excitement was gen - erating on the air. ONE THING’S SURE AND NOTHING’S SURER   THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET— CHILDREN.   IN THE MEANTIME,  10 comIN BETWEEN TIME——  As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of  bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though  a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his  present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been  moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short  of his dreams—not through her own fault but because of  the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her,  beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a  creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out  with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount  of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up  in his ghostly heart. As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly.  His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low  in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I  think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish  warmth because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice  was a deathless song. They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held  out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked  once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely,  possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and  down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there to - gether.The Great Gatsby 10Chapter 6 About this time an ambitious young reporter from New  York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked  him if he had anything to say. ‘Anything to say about what?’ inquired Gatsby politely. ‘Why,—any statement to give out.’ It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man  had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection  which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand.  This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hur - ried out ‘to see.’ It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was  right. Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who  had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on  his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short  of being news. Contemporary legends such as the ‘under - ground pipe-line to Canada’ attached themselves to him,  and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a  house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was  moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just  why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James  Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say. James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name.  He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific  moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when 10 comhe saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidi - ous flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been  loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jer - sey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby  who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE  and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break  him up in half an hour. I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even  then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm peo - ple—his imagination had never really accepted them as  his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West  Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of  himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means  anything, means just that—and he must be about His  Father’s Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretri - cious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that  a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to  this conception he was faithful to the end. For over a year he had been beating his way along the  south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon  fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and  bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through  the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days. He knew  women early and since they spoiled him he became con - temptuous of them, of young virgins because they were  ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about  things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took  for granted. But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most The Great Gatsby 10grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at  night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in  his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the  moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the  floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies un - til drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an  oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an  outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of  the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world  was founded securely on a fairy’s wing. An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some  months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in  southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed  at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to  destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which  he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake  Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on  the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shal - lows along shore. Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada  silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Sev - enty-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made  him many times a millionaire found him physically robust  but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this  an infinite number of women tried to separate him from  his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella  Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Main - tenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were  common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902. He 10 comhad been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five  years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny at Little  Girl Bay. To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up  at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and  glamor in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had  probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.  At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them  elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick,  and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him  to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck  trousers and a yachting cap. And when the TUOLOMEE  left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left   too. He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while  he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skip - per, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew  what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about  and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more  and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years  during which the boat went three times around the con - tinent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact  that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a  week later Dan Cody inhospitably died. I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom,  a grey, florid man with a hard empty face—the pioneer de - bauchee who during one phase of American life brought  back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the fron - tier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that The Great Gatsby 10Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay par - ties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself  he formed the habit of letting liquor alone. And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy  of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He nev - er understood the legal device that was used against him  but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.  He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the  vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substanti - ality of a man. He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down  here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about  his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover  he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached  the point of believing everything and nothing about him.  So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to  speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions  away. It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.  For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the  phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with  Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt— but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon.  I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought  Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but  the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened be - fore. They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a  man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding 10 comhabit who had been there previously. ‘I’m delighted to see you,’ said Gatsby standing on his  porch. ‘I’m delighted that you dropped in.’ As though they cared! ‘Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.’ He walked  around the room quickly, ringing bells. ‘I’ll have something  to drink for you in just a minute.’ He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was  there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given  them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all  they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade?  No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks….  I’m sorry—— ‘Did you have a nice ride?’ ‘Very good roads around here.’ ‘I suppose the automobiles——‘ ‘Yeah.’ Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom  who had accepted the introduction as a stranger. ‘I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not re - membering. ‘So we did. I remember very well.’ ‘About two weeks ago.’ ‘That’s right. You were with Nick here.’ ‘I know your wife,’ continued Gatsby, almost aggressive - ly. ‘That so?’ Tom turned to me. ‘You live near here, Nick?’The Great Gatsby 110‘Next door.’ ‘That so?’ Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation but lounged  back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing ei - ther—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became  cordial. ‘We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,’ she  suggested. ‘What do you say?’ ‘Certainly. I’d be delighted to have you.’ ‘Be ver’ nice,’ said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. ‘Well— think ought to be starting home.’ ‘Please don’t hurry,’ Gatsby urged them. He had control  of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom. ‘Why  don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be sur - prised if some other people dropped in from New York.’ ‘You come to supper with ME,’ said the lady enthusiasti - cally. ‘Both of you.’ This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet. ‘Come along,’ he said—but to her only. ‘I mean it,’ she insisted. ‘I’d love to have you. Lots of  room.’ Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and  he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t. ‘I’m afraid I won’t be able to,’ I said. ‘Well, you come,’ she urged, concentrating on Gatsby. Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear. ‘We won’t be late if we start now,’ she insisted aloud. ‘I haven’t got a horse,’ said Gatsby. ‘I used to ride in the  army but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in 111 commy car. Excuse me for just a minute.’ The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and  the lady began an impassioned conversation aside. ‘My God, I believe the man’s coming,’ said Tom. ‘Doesn’t  he know she doesn’t want him?’ ‘She says she does want him.’ ‘She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul  there.’ He frowned. ‘I wonder where in the devil he met Dai - sy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women  run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all  kinds of crazy fish.’ Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps  and mounted their horses. ‘Come on,’ said Mr. Sloane to Tom, ‘we’re late. We’ve  got to go.’ And then to me: ‘Tell him we couldn’t wait, will  you?’ Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool  nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing  under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light  overcoat in hand came out the front door. Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around  alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her  to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening  its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my  memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There  were the same people, or at least the same sort of people,  the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored,  many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the  air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. The Great Gatsby 11Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept  West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own stan - dards and its own great figures, second to nothing because  it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking  at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening  to look through new eyes at things upon which you have ex - pended your own powers of adjustment. They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the  sparkling hundreds Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous  tricks in her throat. ‘These things excite me SO,’ she whispered. ‘If you want  to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me  know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my  name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green——‘ ‘Look around,’ suggested Gatsby. ‘I’m looking around. I’m having a marvelous——‘ ‘You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard  about.’ Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd. ‘We don’t go around very much,’ he said. ‘In fact I was  just thinking I don’t know a soul here.’ ‘Perhaps you know that lady.’ Gatsby indicated a gor - geous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state  under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that  peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition  of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies. ‘She’s lovely,’ said Daisy. ‘The man bending over her is her director.’ He took them ceremoniously from group to group:11 com‘Mrs. Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan——’ After an in - stant’s hesitation he added: ‘the polo player.’ ‘Oh no,’ objected Tom quickly, ‘Not me.’ But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom re - mained ‘the polo player’ for the rest of the evening. ‘I’ve never met so many celebrities!’ Daisy exclaimed. ‘I  liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue  nose.’ Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small pro - ducer. ‘Well, I liked him anyhow.’ ‘I’d a little rather not be the polo player,’ said Tom pleas - antly, ‘I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in  oblivion.’ Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised  by his graceful, conservative fox-trot—I had never seen him  dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat  on the steps for half an hour while at her request I remained  watchfully in the garden: ‘In case there’s a fire or a flood,’  she explained, ‘or any act of God.’ Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down  to supper together. ‘Do you mind if I eat with some people  over here?’ he said. ‘A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.’ ‘Go ahead,’ answered Daisy genially, ‘And if you want  to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil….’  She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was  ‘common but pretty,’ and I knew that except for the half  hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good  time.The Great Gatsby 11We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault— Gatsby had been called to the phone and I’d enjoyed these  same people only two weeks before. But what had amused  me then turned septic on the air now. ‘How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?’ The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump  against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened  her eyes. ‘Wha?’ A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging  Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke  in Miss Baedeker’s defence: ‘Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cock - tails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she  ought to leave it alone.’ ‘I do leave it alone,’ affirmed the accused hollowly. ‘We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s  somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ ‘ ‘She’s much obliged, I’m sure,’ said another friend, with - out gratitude. ‘But you got her dress all wet when you stuck  her head in the pool.’ ‘Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,’ mum - bled Miss Baedeker. ‘They almost drowned me once over in  New Jersey.’ ‘Then you ought to leave it alone,’ countered Doctor Civ - et. ‘Speak for yourself!’ cried Miss Baedeker violently. ‘Your  hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!’ It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was 11 comstanding with Daisy and watching the moving picture di - rector and his Star. They were still under the white plum  tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray  of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been  very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this  proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one  ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek. ‘I like her,’ said Daisy, ‘I think she’s lovely.’ But the rest offended her—and inarguably, because it  wasn’t a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West  Egg, this unprecedented ‘place’ that Broadway had begot - ten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw  vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too  obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut  from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the  very simplicity she failed to understand. I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for  their car. It was dark here in front: only the bright door  sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black  morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing- room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite  procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an in - visible glass. ‘Who is this Gatsby anyhow?’ demanded Tom suddenly.  ‘Some big bootlegger?’ ‘Where’d you hear that?’ I inquired. ‘I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich  people are just big bootleggers, you know.’ ‘Not Gatsby,’ I said shortly.The Great Gatsby 11He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive  crunched under his feet. ‘Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this  menagerie together.’ A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar. ‘At least they’re more interesting than the people we  know,’ she said with an effort. ‘You didn’t look so interested.’ ‘Well, I was.’ Tom laughed and turned to me. ‘Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to  put her under a cold shower?’ Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhyth - mic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it  had never had before and would never have again. When  the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in  a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a  little of her warm human magic upon the air. ‘Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,’ she said  suddenly. ‘That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force  their way in and he’s too polite to object.’ ‘I’d like to know who he is and what he does,’ insisted  Tom. ‘And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.’ ‘I can tell you right now,’ she answered. ‘He owned some  drug stores, a lot of drug stores. He built them up himself.’ The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive. ‘Good night, Nick,’ said Daisy. Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps  where ‘Three o’Clock in the Morning,’ a neat, sad little waltz 11 comof that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the  very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic pos - sibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there  in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What  would happen now in the dim incalculable hours? Perhaps  some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinite - ly rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant  young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one mo - ment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years  of unwavering devotion. I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he  was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable  swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the  black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest  rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the  tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his  eyes were bright and tired. ‘She didn’t like it,’ he said immediately. ‘Of course she did.’ ‘She didn’t like it,’ he insisted. ‘She didn’t have a good  time.’ He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depres - sion. ‘I feel far away from her,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to make her  understand.’ ‘You mean about the dance?’ ‘The dance?’ He dismissed all the dances he had given  with a snap of his fingers. ‘Old sport, the dance is unim - portant.’The Great Gatsby 11He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go  to Tom and say: ‘I never loved you.’ After she had obliter - ated three years with that sentence they could decide upon  the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was  that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville  and be married from her house—just as if it were five years  ago. ‘And she doesn’t understand,’ he said. ‘She used to be  able to understand. We’d sit for hours——‘ He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate  path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flow - ers. ‘I wouldn’t ask too much of her,’ I ventured. ‘You can’t  repeat the past.’ ‘Can’t repeat the past?’ he cried incredulously. ‘Why of  course you can!’ He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurk - ing here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his  hand. ‘I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,’ he  said, nodding determinedly. ‘She’ll see.’ He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he  wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps,  that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused  and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a  certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find  out what that thing was…. … One autumn night, five years before, they had been  walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and 11 comthey came to a place where there were no trees and the side - walk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and  turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that  mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes  of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming  out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among  the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the  blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted  to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he  climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of  life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder. His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came  up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and  forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath,  his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So  he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork  that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his  lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the in - carnation was complete. Through all he said, even through his appalling sen - timentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive  rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard some - where a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take  shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as  though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of  startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost  remembered was uncommunicable forever.The Great Gatsby 10Chapter 7 It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest  that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday  night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Tri - malchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles  which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a  minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were  sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a vil - lainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door. ‘Is Mr. Gatsby sick?’ ‘Nope.’ After a pause he added ‘sir’ in a dilatory, grudg - ing way. ‘I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell  him Mr. Carraway came over.’ ‘Who?’ he demanded rudely. ‘Carraway.’ ‘Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.’ Abruptly he slammed  the door. My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every  servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with  half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village  to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate sup - plies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the  kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the 11 comvillage was that the new people weren’t servants at all. Next day Gatsby called me on the phone. ‘Going away?’ I inquired. ‘No, old sport.’ ‘I hear you fired all your servants.’ ‘I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes  over quite often—in the afternoons.’ So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house  at the disapproval in her eyes. ‘They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do some - thing for. They’re all brothers and sisters. They used to run  a small hotel.’ ‘I see.’ He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to  lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there.  Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed re - lieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And  yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion  for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that  Gatsby had outlined in the garden. The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the  warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the  tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National  Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The  straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion;  the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into  her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened  under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a  desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.The Great Gatsby 1‘Oh, my!’ she gasped. I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to  her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the  corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it—but ev - ery one near by, including the woman, suspected me just  the same. ‘Hot!’ said the conductor to familiar faces. ‘Some weath - er! Hot! Hot! Hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it  … ?’ My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark  stain from his hand. That any one should care in this heat  whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the  pajama pocket over his heart! … Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint  wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby  and me as we waited at the door. ‘The master’s body!’ roared the butler into the mouth - piece. ‘I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far  too hot to touch this noon!’ What he really said was: ‘Yes … yes … I’ll see.’ He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening  slightly, to take our stiff straw hats. ‘Madame expects you in the salon!’ he cried, needless - ly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture  was an affront to the common store of life. The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and  cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like  silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against  the singing breeze of the fans.1 com‘We can’t move,’ they said together. Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested  for a moment in mine. ‘And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?’ I inquired. Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky,  at the hall telephone. Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and  gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and  laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder  rose from her bosom into the air. ‘The rumor is,’ whispered Jordan, ‘that that’s Tom’s girl  on the telephone.’ We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with an - noyance. ‘Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all….  I’m under no obligations to you at all…. And as for your  bothering me about it at lunch time I won’t stand that at  all!’ ‘Holding down the receiver,’ said Daisy cynically. ‘No, he’s not,’ I assured her. ‘It’s a bona fide deal. I happen  to know about it.’ Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a mo - ment with his thick body, and hurried into the room. ‘Mr. Gatsby!’ He put out his broad, flat hand with well- concealed dislike. ‘I’m glad to see you, sir…. Nick….’ ‘Make us a cold drink,’ cried Daisy. As he left the room again she got up and went over  to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the  mouth. ‘You know I love you,’ she murmured.The Great Gatsby 1‘You forget there’s a lady present,’ said Jordan. Daisy looked around doubtfully. ‘You kiss Nick too.’ ‘What a low, vulgar girl!’ ‘I don’t care!’ cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick  fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guilt - ily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a  little girl came into the room. ‘Bles-sed pre-cious,’ she crooned, holding out her arms.  ‘Come to your own mother that loves you.’ The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the  room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress. ‘The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your  old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do.’ Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small re - luctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with  surprise. I don’t think he had ever really believed in its ex - istence before. ‘I got dressed before luncheon,’ said the child, turning  eagerly to Daisy. ‘That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.’ Her  face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck.  ‘You dream, you. You absolute little dream.’ ‘Yes,’ admitted the child calmly. ‘Aunt Jordan’s got on a  white dress too.’ ‘How do you like mother’s friends?’ Daisy turned her  around so that she faced Gatsby. ‘Do you think they’re pret - ty?’ ‘Where’s Daddy?’1 com‘She doesn’t look like her father,’ explained Daisy. ‘She  looks like me. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.’ Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step for - ward and held out her hand. ‘Come, Pammy.’ ‘Goodbye, sweetheart!’ With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined  child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door,  just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that  clicked full of ice. Gatsby took up his drink. ‘They certainly look cool,’ he said, with visible tension. We drank in long greedy swallows. ‘I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter ev - ery year,’ said Tom genially. ‘It seems that pretty soon the  earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just  the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year. ‘Come outside,’ he suggested to Gatsby, ‘I’d like you to  have a look at the place.’ I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound,  stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward  the fresher sea. Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he  raised his hand and pointed across the bay. ‘I’m right across from you.’ ‘So you are.’ Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and  the weedy refuse of the dog days along shore. Slowly the  white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of  the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding The Great Gatsby 1blessed isles. ‘There’s sport for you,’ said Tom, nodding. ‘I’d like to be  out there with him for about an hour.’ We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too,  against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the  cold ale. ‘What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon,’ cried Dai - sy, ‘and the day after that, and the next thirty years?’ ‘Don’t be morbid,’ Jordan said. ‘Life starts all over again  when it gets crisp in the fall.’ ‘But it’s so hot,’ insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, ‘And  everything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!’ Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against  it, moulding its senselessness into forms. ‘I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,’ Tom was  saying to Gatsby, ‘but I’m the first man who ever made a  stable out of a garage.’ ‘Who wants to go to town?’ demanded Daisy insistently.  Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her. ‘Ah,’ she cried, ‘you look  so cool.’ Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other,  alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the ta - ble. ‘You always look so cool,’ she repeated. She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan  saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little and he  looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just rec - ognized her as some one he knew a long time ago. ‘You resemble the advertisement of the man,’ she went on 1 cominnocently. ‘You know the advertisement of the man——‘ ‘All right,’ broke in Tom quickly, ‘I’m perfectly willing to  go to town. Come on—we’re all going to town.’ He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his  wife. No one moved. ‘Come on!’ His temper cracked a little. ‘What’s the mat - ter, anyhow? If we’re going to town let’s start.’ His hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore  to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to  our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive. ‘Are we just going to go?’ she objected. ‘Like this? Aren’t  we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?’ ‘Everybody smoked all through lunch.’ ‘Oh, let’s have fun,’ she begged him. ‘It’s too hot to fuss.’ He didn’t answer. ‘Have it your own way,’ she said. ‘Come on, Jordan.’ They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood  there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve  of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby  started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom  wheeled and faced him expectantly. ‘Have you got your stables here?’ asked Gatsby with an  effort. ‘About a quarter of a mile down the road.’ ‘Oh.’ A pause. ‘I don’t see the idea of going to town,’ broke out Tom sav - agely. ‘Women get these notions in their heads——‘ ‘Shall we take anything to drink?’ called Daisy from an The Great Gatsby 1upper window. ‘I’ll get some whiskey,’ answered Tom. He went inside. Gatsby turned to me rigidly: ‘I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.’ ‘She’s got an indiscreet voice,’ I remarked. ‘It’s full of— —‘ I hesitated. ‘Her voice is full of money,’ he said suddenly. That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of  money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell  in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it…. High in a  white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl…. Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in  a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight  hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their  arms. ‘Shall we all go in my car?’ suggested Gatsby. He felt the  hot, green leather of the seat. ‘I ought to have left it in the  shade.’ ‘Is it standard shift?’ demanded Tom. ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to  town.’ The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby. ‘I don’t think there’s much gas,’ he objected. ‘Plenty of gas,’ said Tom boisterously. He looked at the  gauge. ‘And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can  buy anything at a drug store nowadays.’ A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Dai -1 comsy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression,  at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if  I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s  face. ‘Come on, Daisy,’ said Tom, pressing her with his hand  toward Gatsby’s car. ‘I’ll take you in this circus wagon.’ He opened the door but she moved out from the circle  of his arm. ‘You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the cou - pé.’ She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her  hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gats - by’s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and  we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight  behind. ‘Did you see that?’ demanded Tom. ‘See what?’ He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must  have known all along. ‘You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?’ he suggested.  ‘Perhaps I am, but I have a—almost a second sight, some - times, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don’t believe  that, but science——‘ He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him,  pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss. ‘I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,’ he contin - ued. ‘I could have gone deeper if I’d known——‘ ‘Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?’ inquired Jor - dan humorously.The Great Gatsby 10‘What?’ Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. ‘A me - dium?’ ‘About Gatsby.’ ‘About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a  small investigation of his past.’ ‘And you found he was an Oxford man,’ said Jordan  helpfully. ‘An Oxford man!’ He was incredulous. ‘Like hell he is!  He wears a pink suit.’ ‘Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.’ ‘Oxford, New Mexico,’ snorted Tom contemptuously, ‘or  something like that.’ ‘Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite  him to lunch?’ demanded Jordan crossly. ‘Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were mar - ried—God knows where!’ We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware  of it, we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J.  Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I re - membered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline. ‘We’ve got enough to get us to town,’ said Tom. ‘But there’s a garage right here,’ objected Jordan. ‘I don’t  want to get stalled in this baking heat.’ Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an  abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the  proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment  and gazed hollow-eyed at the car. ‘Let’s have some gas!’ cried Tom roughly. ‘What do you  think we stopped for—to admire the view?’11 com‘I’m sick,’ said Wilson without moving. ‘I been sick all  day.’ ‘What’s the matter?’ ‘I’m all run down.’ ‘Well, shall I help myself?’ Tom demanded. ‘You sound - ed well enough on the phone.’ With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the  doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the  tank. In the sunlight his face was green. ‘I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,’ he said. ‘But I  need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were  going to do with your old car.’ ‘How do you like this one?’ inquired Tom. ‘I bought it  last week.’ ‘It’s a nice yellow one,’ said Wilson, as he strained at the  handle. ‘Like to buy it?’ ‘Big chance,’ Wilson smiled faintly. ‘No, but I could make  some money on the other.’ ‘What do you want money for, all of a sudden?’ ‘I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and  I want to go west.’ ‘Your wife does!’ exclaimed Tom, startled. ‘She’s been talking about it for ten years.’ He rested for  a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. ‘And now  she’s going whether she wants to or not. I’m going to get  her away.’ The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the  flash of a waving hand.The Great Gatsby 1‘What do I owe you?’ demanded Tom harshly. ‘I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,’  remarked Wilson. ‘That’s why I want to get away. That’s why  I been bothering you about the car.’ ‘What do I owe you?’ ‘Dollar twenty.’ The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse  me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so  far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom. He had discov - ered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in  another world and the shock had made him physically sick.  I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel  discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me  that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or  race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the  well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably  guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child. ‘I’ll let you have that car,’ said Tom. ‘I’ll send it over to - morrow afternoon.’ That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in  the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as  though I had been warned of something behind. Over the  ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their  vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were  regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty  feet away. In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had  been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering  down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no con -1 comsciousness of being observed and one emotion after another  crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing pic - ture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an  expression I had often seen on women’s faces but on Myrtle  Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until  I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed  not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his  wife. There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple  mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips  of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure  and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control.  Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double  purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind,  and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour,  until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in  sight of the easygoing blue coupé. ‘Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,’ sug - gested Jordan. ‘I love New York on summer afternoons  when every one’s away. There’s something very sensuous  about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going  to fall into your hands.’ The word ‘sensuous’ had the effect of further disquieting  Tom but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to  a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside. ‘Where are we going?’ she cried. ‘How about the movies?’ ‘It’s so hot,’ she complained. ‘You go. We’ll ride around  and meet you after.’ With an effort her wit rose faintly, The Great Gatsby 1‘We’ll meet you on some corner. I’ll be the man smoking  two cigarettes.’ ‘We can’t argue about it here,’ Tom said impatiently as a  truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. ‘You follow me  to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.’ Several times he turned his head and looked back for  their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until  they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart  down a side street and out of his life forever. But they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step  of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel. The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by  herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp  physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear  kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and in - termittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The  notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five  bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more  tangible form as ‘a place to have a mint julep.’ Each of us  said over and over that it was a ‘crazy idea’—we all talked at  once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think,  that we were being very funny…. The room was large and stifling, and, though it was al - ready four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a  gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mir - ror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair. ‘It’s a swell suite,’ whispered Jordan respectfully and ev - ery one laughed. ‘Open another window,’ commanded Daisy, without 1 comturning around. ‘There aren’t any more.’ ‘Well, we’d better telephone for an axe——‘ ‘The thing to do is to forget about the heat,’ said Tom im - patiently. ‘You make it ten times worse by crabbing about  it.’ He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put  it on the table. ‘Why not let her alone, old sport?’ remarked Gatsby.  ‘You’re the one that wanted to come to town.’ There was a moment of silence. The telephone book  slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereup - on Jordan whispered ‘Excuse me’—but this time no one  laughed. ‘I’ll pick it up,’ I offered. ‘I’ve got it.’ Gatsby examined the parted string, mut - tered ‘Hum!’ in an interested way, and tossed the book on  a chair. ‘That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?’ said Tom  sharply. ‘What is?’ ‘All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?’ ‘Now see here, Tom,’ said Daisy, turning around from  the mirror, ‘if you’re going to make personal remarks I  won’t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the  mint julep.’ As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat ex - ploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous  chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ball -The Great Gatsby 1room below. ‘Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!’ cried Jordan  dismally. ‘Still—I was married in the middle of June,’ Daisy re - membered, ‘Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who  was it fainted, Tom?’ ‘Biloxi,’ he answered shortly. ‘A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made box - es—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.’ ‘They carried him into my house,’ appended Jordan,  ‘because we lived just two doors from the church. And he  stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out.  The day after he left Daddy died.’ After a moment she added  as if she might have sounded irreverent, ‘There wasn’t any  connection.’ ‘I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,’ I re - marked. ‘That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history  before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use  today.’ The music had died down as the ceremony began and  now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by in - termittent cries of ‘Yea—ea—ea!’ and finally by a burst of  jazz as the dancing began. ‘We’re getting old,’ said Daisy. ‘If we were young we’d  rise and dance.’ ‘Remember Biloxi,’ Jordan warned her. ‘Where’d you  know him, Tom?’ ‘Biloxi?’ He concentrated with an effort. ‘I didn’t know 1 comhim. He was a friend of Daisy’s.’ ‘He was not,’ she denied. ‘I’d never seen him before. He  came down in the private car.’ ‘Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Lou - isville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and  asked if we had room for him.’ Jordan smiled. ‘He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he  was president of your class at Yale.’ Tom and I looked at each other blankly. ‘BilOxi?’ ‘First place, we didn’t have any president——‘ Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed  him suddenly. ‘By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford  man.’ ‘Not exactly.’ ‘Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.’ ‘Yes—I went there.’ A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting: ‘You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to  New Haven.’ Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with  crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his  ‘Thank you’ and the soft closing of the door. This tremen - dous detail was to be cleared up at last. ‘I told you I went there,’ said Gatsby. ‘I heard you, but I’d like to know when.’ ‘It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. The Great Gatsby 1That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.’ Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.  But we were all looking at Gatsby. ‘It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers  after the Armistice,’ he continued. ‘We could go to any of  the universities in England or France.’ I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one  of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experi - enced before. Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table. ‘Open the whiskey, Tom,’ she ordered. ‘And I’ll make you  a mint julep. Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself….  Look at the mint!’ ‘Wait a minute,’ snapped Tom, ‘I want to ask Mr. Gatsby  one more question.’ ‘Go on,’ Gatsby said politely. ‘What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house  anyhow?’ They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was con - tent. ‘He isn’t causing a row.’ Daisy looked desperately from  one to the other. ‘You’re causing a row. Please have a little  self control.’ ‘Self control!’ repeated Tom incredulously. ‘I suppose the  latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere  make love to your wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count  me out…. Nowadays people begin by sneering at family  life and family institutions and next they’ll throw every - thing overboard and have intermarriage between black and 1 comwhite.’ Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself  standing alone on the last barrier of civilization. ‘We’re all white here,’ murmured Jordan. ‘I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I  suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in or - der to have any friends—in the modern world.’ Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh  whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from liber - tine to prig was so complete. ‘I’ve got something to tell YOU, old sport,——’ began  Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention. ‘Please don’t!’ she interrupted helplessly. ‘Please let’s all  go home. Why don’t we all go home?’ ‘That’s a good idea.’ I got up. ‘Come on, Tom. Nobody  wants a drink.’ ‘I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.’ ‘Your wife doesn’t love you,’ said Gatsby. ‘She’s never  loved you. She loves me.’ ‘You must be crazy!’ exclaimed Tom automatically. Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement. ‘She never loved you, do you hear?’ he cried. ‘She only  married you because I was poor and she was tired of wait - ing for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she  never loved any one except me!’ At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gats - by insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as  though neither of them had anything to conceal and it  would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emo -The Great Gatsby 10tions. ‘Sit down Daisy.’ Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for  the paternal note. ‘What’s been going on? I want to hear all  about it.’ ‘I told you what’s been going on,’ said Gatsby. ‘Going on  for five years—and you didn’t know.’ Tom turned to Daisy sharply. ‘You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?’ ‘Not seeing,’ said Gatsby. ‘No, we couldn’t meet. But both  of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t  know. I used to laugh sometimes—‘but there was no laugh - ter in his eyes, ‘to think that you didn’t know.’ ‘Oh—that’s all.’ Tom tapped his thick fingers together  like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair. ‘You’re crazy!’ he exploded. ‘I can’t speak about what  happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then— and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her  unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all  the rest of that’s a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when  she married me and she loves me now.’ ‘No,’ said Gatsby, shaking his head. ‘She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets  foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s do - ing.’ He nodded sagely. ‘And what’s more, I love Daisy too.  Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of my - self, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all  the time.’ ‘You’re revolting,’ said Daisy. She turned to me, and her  voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrill -11 coming scorn: ‘Do you know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised  that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.’ Gatsby walked over and stood beside her. ‘Daisy, that’s all over now,’ he said earnestly. ‘It doesn’t  matter any more. Just tell him the truth—that you never  loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.’ She looked at him blindly. ‘Why,—how could I love  him—possibly?’ ‘You never loved him.’ She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort  of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was do - ing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing  anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late. ‘I never loved him,’ she said, with perceptible reluc - tance. ‘Not at Kapiolani?’ demanded Tom suddenly. ‘No.’ From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating  chords were drifting up on hot waves of air. ‘Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to  keep your shoes dry?’ There was a husky tenderness in his  tone. ‘… Daisy?’ ‘Please don’t.’ Her voice was cold, but the rancour was  gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. ‘There, Jay,’ she said— but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling.  Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on  the carpet. ‘Oh, you want too much!’ she cried to Gatsby. ‘I love you  now—isn’t that enough? I can’t help what’s past.’ She began The Great Gatsby 1to sob helplessly. ‘I did love him once—but I loved you too.’ Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed. ‘You loved me TOO?’ he repeated. ‘Even that’s a lie,’ said Tom savagely. ‘She didn’t know  you were alive. Why,—there’re things between Daisy and  me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever  forget.’ The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby. ‘I want to speak to Daisy alone,’ he insisted. ‘She’s all ex - cited now——‘ ‘Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,’ she admitted  in a pitiful voice. ‘It wouldn’t be true.’ ‘Of course it wouldn’t,’ agreed Tom. She turned to her husband. ‘As if it mattered to you,’ she said. ‘Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you  from now on.’ ‘You don’t understand,’ said Gatsby, with a touch of pan - ic. ‘You’re not going to take care of her any more.’ ‘I’m not?’ Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He  could afford to control himself now. ‘Why’s that?’ ‘Daisy’s leaving you.’ ‘Nonsense.’ ‘I am, though,’ she said with a visible effort. ‘She’s not leaving me!’ Tom’s words suddenly leaned  down over Gatsby. ‘Certainly not for a common swindler  who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.’ ‘I won’t stand this!’ cried Daisy. ‘Oh, please let’s get out.’ ‘Who are you, anyhow?’ broke out Tom. ‘You’re one of 1 comthat bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that  much I happen to know. I’ve made a little investigation into  your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.’ ‘You can suit yourself about that, old sport.’ said Gatsby  steadily. ‘I found out what your ‘drug stores’ were.’ He turned to  us and spoke rapidly. ‘He and this Wolfshiem bought up a  lot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and sold  grain alcohol over the counter. That’s one of his little stunts.  I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I  wasn’t far wrong.’ ‘What about it?’ said Gatsby politely. ‘I guess your friend  Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.’ ‘And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go  to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to  hear Walter on the subject of YOU.’ ‘He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up  some money, old sport.’ ‘Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!’ cried Tom. Gatsby said  nothing. ‘Walter could have you up on the betting laws too,  but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.’ That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in  Gatsby’s face. ‘That drug store business was just small change,’ con - tinued Tom slowly, ‘but you’ve got something on now that  Walter’s afraid to tell me about.’ I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between  Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to  balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her The Great Gatsby 1chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at  his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt  for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had ‘killed a  man.’ For a moment the set of his face could be described in  just that fantastic way. It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, deny - ing everything, defending his name against accusations that  had not been made. But with every word she was drawing  further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only  the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away,  trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling un - happily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the  room. The voice begged again to go. ‘PLEASE, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.’ Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, what - ever courage she had had, were definitely gone. ‘You two start on home, Daisy,’ said Tom. ‘In Mr. Gats - by’s car.’ She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with  magnanimous scorn. ‘Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his  presumptuous little flirtation is over.’ They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made ac - cidental, isolated, like ghosts even from our pity. After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the un - opened bottle of whiskey in the towel. ‘Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?’ I didn’t answer.1 com‘Nick?’ He asked again. ‘What?’ ‘Want any?’ ‘No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday.’ I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menac - ing road of a new decade. It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him  and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exult - ing and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan  and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult  of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits  and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade  with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade  of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thin - ning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was  Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to  carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed  over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s  shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with  the reassuring pressure of her hand. So we drove on toward death through the cooling twi - light. The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint be - side the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest.  He had slept through the heat until after five, when he  strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in  his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking  all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson re - fused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did. While The Great Gatsby 1his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket  broke out overhead. ‘I’ve got my wife locked in up there,’ explained Wilson  calmly. ‘She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow  and then we’re going to move away.’ Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for  four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of  such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out  men: when he wasn’t working he sat on a chair in the door - way and stared at the people and the cars that passed along  the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed  in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife’s man and  not his own. So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had hap - pened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began  to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask  him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days.  Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came  past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took  the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later.  But he didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he  came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of  the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud  and scolding, downstairs in the garage. ‘Beat me!’ he heard her cry. ‘Throw me down and beat  me, you dirty little coward!’ A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her  hands and shouting; before he could move from his door  the business was over.1 comThe ‘death car’ as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop;  it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically  for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend.  Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color—he told the first po - liceman that it was light green. The other car, the one going  toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond,  and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life  violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her  thick, dark blood with the dust. Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they  had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration,  they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap  and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The  mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though  she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality  she had stored so long. We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd  when we were still some distance away. ‘Wreck!’ said Tom. ‘That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little  business at last.’ He slowed down, but still without any intention of stop - ping until, as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the  people at the garage door made him automatically put on  the brakes. ‘We’ll take a look,’ he said doubtfully, ‘just a look.’ I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which is - sued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got  out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved it - self into the words ‘Oh, my God!’ uttered over and over in The Great Gatsby 1a gasping moan. ‘There’s some bad trouble here,’ said Tom excitedly. He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of  heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light  in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he made a harsh  sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement  of his powerful arms pushed his way through. The circle closed up again with a running murmur of ex - postulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at  all. Then new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and I  were pushed suddenly inside. Myrtle Wilson’s body wrapped in a blanket and then  in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in  the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tom,  with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next  to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names  with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I  couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that  echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw  Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, sway - ing back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both  hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and  attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoul - der, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop  slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall  and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out inces - santly his high horrible call. ‘O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga- od!’1 comPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring  around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled  incoherent remark to the policeman. ‘M-a-v—’ the policeman was saying, ‘—o——‘ ‘No,—r—’ corrected the man, ‘M-a-v-r-o——‘ ‘Listen to me!’ muttered Tom fiercely. ‘r—’ said the policeman, ‘o——‘ ‘g——‘ ‘g—’ He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on  his shoulder. ‘What you want, fella?’ ‘What happened—that’s what I want to know!’ ‘Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.’ ‘Instantly killed,’ repeated Tom, staring. ‘She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus  car.’ ‘There was two cars,’ said Michaelis, ‘one comin’, one  goin’, see?’ ‘Going where?’ asked the policeman keenly. ‘One goin’ each way. Well, she—’ His hand rose toward  the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side, ‘—she  ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right  into her goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.’ ‘What’s the name of this place here?’ demanded the of - ficer. ‘Hasn’t got any name.’ A pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near. ‘It was a yellow car,’ he said, ‘big yellow car. New.’ ‘See the accident?’ asked the policeman. ‘No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n The Great Gatsby 10forty. Going fifty, sixty.’ ‘Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I  want to get his name.’ Some words of this conversation must have reached Wil - son swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme  found voice among his gasping cries. ‘You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know  what kind of car it was!’ Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his  shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to  Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by  the upper arms. ‘You’ve got to pull yourself together,’ he said with sooth - ing gruffness. Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes  and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom  held him upright. ‘Listen,’ said Tom, shaking him a little. ‘I just got here a  minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé  we’ve been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this  afternoon wasn’t mine, do you hear? I haven’t seen it all af - ternoon.’ Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he  said but the policeman caught something in the tone and  looked over with truculent eyes. ‘What’s all that?’ he demanded. ‘I’m a friend of his.’ Tom turned his head but kept his  hands firm on Wilson’s body. ‘He says he knows the car that  did it…. It was a yellow car.’11 comSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspi - ciously at Tom. ‘And what color’s your car?’ ‘It’s a blue car, a coupé.’ ‘We’ve come straight from New York,’ I said. Some one who had been driving a little behind us con - firmed this and the policeman turned away. ‘Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct——‘ Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the  office, set him down in a chair and came back. ‘If somebody’ll come here and sit with him!’ he snapped  authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing  closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the  room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the  single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to  me he whispered ‘Let’s get out.’ Self consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking  the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, pass - ing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in  wild hope half an hour ago. Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then  his foot came down hard and the coupé raced along through  the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw  that the tears were overflowing down his face. ‘The God Damn coward!’ he whimpered. ‘He didn’t even  stop his car.’ The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us  through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the  porch and looked up at the second floor where two win -The Great Gatsby 1dows bloomed with light among the vines. ‘Daisy’s home,’ he said. As we got out of the car he glanced  at me and frowned slightly. ‘I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s  nothing we can do tonight.’ A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and  with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to  the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phras - es. ‘I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while  you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen  and have them get you some supper—if you want any.’ He  opened the door. ‘Come in.’ ‘No thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll  wait outside.’ Jordan put her hand on my arm. ‘Won’t you come in, Nick?’ ‘No thanks.’ I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But  Jordan lingered for a moment more. ‘It’s only half past nine,’ she said. I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them  for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must  have seen something of this in my expression for she turned  abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I  sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until  I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice call - ing a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from  the house intending to wait by the gate.1 comI hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and  Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I  must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could  think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit un - der the moon. ‘What are you doing?’ I inquired. ‘Just standing here, old sport.’ Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I  knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t  have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of ‘Wolf - shiem’s people,’ behind him in the dark shrubbery. ‘Did you see any trouble on the road?’ he asked after a  minute. ‘Yes.’ He hesitated. ‘Was she killed?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the  shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.’ He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that  mattered. ‘I got to West Egg by a side road,’ he went on, ‘and left the  car in my garage. I don’t think anybody saw us but of course  I can’t be sure.’ I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it  necessary to tell him he was wrong. ‘Who was the woman?’ he inquired. ‘Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage.  How the devil did it happen?’The Great Gatsby 1‘Well, I tried to swing the wheel——’ He broke off, and  suddenly I guessed at the truth. ‘Was Daisy driving?’ ‘Yes,’ he said after a moment, ‘but of course I’ll say I was.  You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and  she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman  rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the  other way. It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me  that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody  she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the wom - an toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and  turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt  the shock—it must have killed her instantly.’ ‘It ripped her open——‘ ‘Don’t tell me, old sport.’ He winced. ‘Anyhow—Daisy  stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t so I  pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my  lap and I drove on. ‘She’ll be all right tomorrow,’ he said presently. ‘I’m just  going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that  unpleasantness this afternoon. She’s locked herself into her  room and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the  light out and on again.’ ‘He won’t touch her,’ I said. ‘He’s not thinking about  her.’ ‘I don’t trust him, old sport.’ ‘How long are you going to wait?’ ‘All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed.’ A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found 1 comout that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a  connection in it—he might think anything. I looked at the  house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs  and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the second floor. ‘You wait here,’ I said. ‘I’ll see if there’s any sign of a com - motion.’ I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the  gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The draw - ing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was  empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June  night three months before I came to a small rectangle of  light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was  drawn but I found a rift at the sill. Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the  kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between  them and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across  the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen  upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up  at him and nodded in agreement. They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the  chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either.  There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about  the picture and anybody would have said that they were  conspiring together. As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its  way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was wait - ing where I had left him in the drive. ‘Is it all quiet up there?’ he asked anxiously. ‘Yes, it’s all quiet.’ I hesitated. ‘You’d better come home The Great Gatsby 1and get some sleep.’ He shook his head. ‘I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night,  old sport.’ He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back  eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence  marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left  him standing there in the moonlight—watching over noth - ing.1 comChapter 8 I couldn’t sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning in - cessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between  grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams. Toward  dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive and immediately  I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had  something to tell him, something to warn him about and  morning would be too late. Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open  and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with  dejection or sleep. ‘Nothing happened,’ he said wanly. ‘I waited, and about  four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a  minute and then turned out the light.’ His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did  that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cig - arettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions  and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light  switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the  keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount  of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though  they hadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor  on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside.  Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room  we sat smoking out into the darkness.The Great Gatsby 1‘You ought to go away,’ I said. ‘It’s pretty certain they’ll  trace your car.’ ‘Go away NOW, old sport?’ ‘Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.’ He wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy  until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at  some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free. It was this night that he told me the strange story of his  youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because ‘Jay Gatsby’  had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice and the  long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he  would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve,  but he wanted to talk about Daisy. She was the first ‘nice’ girl he had ever known. In vari - ous unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such  people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between.  He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at  first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It  amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house  before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was  that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his  tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about  it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than  other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place  through its corridors and of romances that were not musty  and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing  and redolent of this year’s shining motor cars and of danc - es whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him too  that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her 1 comvalue in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house,  pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant  emotions. But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal  accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gats - by, he was at present a penniless young man without a past,  and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might  slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He  took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously— eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her  because he had no real right to touch her hand. He might have despised himself, for he had certainly  taken her under false pretenses. I don’t mean that he had  traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately  given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was  a person from much the same stratum as herself—that he  was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact he had  no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing  behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal  government to be blown anywhere about the world. But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he  had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he  could and go—but now he found that he had committed  himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was  extraordinary but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary  a ‘nice’ girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into  her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He felt married  to her, that was all. When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who The Great Gatsby 10was breathless, who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was  bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of  the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him  and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught  a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming  than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the  youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of  the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like  silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor. ‘I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out  I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d  throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with  me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different  things from her…. Well, there I was, way off my ambitions,  getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I  didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could  have a better time telling her what I was going to do?’ On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with  Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall  day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and  then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once  he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made  them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory  for the long parting the next day promised. They had never  been closer in their month of love nor communicated more  profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent  lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end  of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep. He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain 11 combefore he went to the front and following the Argonne bat - tles he got his majority and the command of the divisional  machine guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to  get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent  him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—there was a  quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t see  why he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the  world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his pres - ence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the  right thing after all. For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent  of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras  which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness  and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the sax - ophones wailed the hopeless comment of the ‘Beale Street  Blues’ while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers  shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were  always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet  fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose pet - als blown by the sad horns around the floor. Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move  again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half  a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing  asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening  dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her  bed. And all the time something within her was crying for  a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately— and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of  money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at The Great Gatsby 1hand. That force took shape in the middle of spring with the ar - rival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness  about his person and his position and Daisy was flattered.  Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief.  The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford. It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about open - ing the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house  with grey turning, gold turning light. The shadow of a tree  fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing  among the blue leaves. There was a slow pleasant movement  in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool lovely day. ‘I don’t think she ever loved him.’ Gatsby turned around  from a window and looked at me challengingly. ‘You must  remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon.  He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that  made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the  result was she hardly knew what she was saying.’ He sat down gloomily. ‘Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute,  when they were first married—and loved me more even  then, do you see?’ Suddenly he came out with a curious remark: ‘In any case,’ he said, ‘it was just personal.’ What could you make of that, except to suspect some  intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be  measured? He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were  still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irre -1 comsistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He  stayed there a week, walking the streets where their foot - steps had clicked together through the November night and  revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driv - en in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed  to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his  idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was  pervaded with a melancholy beauty. He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might  have found her—that he was leaving her behind. The day- coach—he was penniless now—was hot. He went out to the  open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the sta - tion slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved  by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley  raced them for a minute with people in it who might once  have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street. The track curved and now it was going away from the  sun which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in bene - diction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her  breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch  only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had  made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for  his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it,  the freshest and the best, forever. It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went  out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in  the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air. The  gardener, the last one of Gatsby’s former servants, came to  the foot of the steps.The Great Gatsby 1‘I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll  start falling pretty soon and then there’s always trouble  with the pipes.’ ‘Don’t do it today,’ Gatsby answered. He turned to me  apologetically. ‘You know, old sport, I’ve never used that  pool all summer?’ I looked at my watch and stood up. ‘Twelve minutes to my train.’ I didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent  stroke of work but it was more than that—I didn’t want to  leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I  could get myself away. ‘I’ll call you up,’ I said finally. ‘Do, old sport.’ ‘I’ll call you about noon.’ We walked slowly down the steps. ‘I suppose Daisy’ll call too.’ He looked at me anxiously as  if he hoped I’d corroborate this. ‘I suppose so.’ ‘Well—goodbye.’ We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached  the hedge I remembered something and turned around. ‘They’re a rotten crowd,’ I shouted across the lawn. ‘You’re  worth the whole damn bunch put together.’ I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compli - ment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from  beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face  broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d  been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gor -1 comgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against  the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came  to his ancestral home three months before. The lawn and  drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed  at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, conceal - ing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye. I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thank - ing him for that—I and the others. ‘Goodbye,’ I called. ‘I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.’ Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations  on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in  my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me and I  started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was  Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because  the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and  clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any oth - er way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something  fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come  sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed  harsh and dry. ‘I’ve left Daisy’s house,’ she said. ‘I’m at Hempstead and  I’m going down to Southampton this afternoon.’ Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but  the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid. ‘You weren’t so nice to me last night.’ ‘How could it have mattered then?’ Silence for a moment. Then— ‘However—I want to see you.’ ‘I want to see you too.’The Great Gatsby 1‘Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town  this afternoon?’ ‘No—I don’t think this afternoon.’ ‘Very well.’ ‘It’s impossible this afternoon. Various——‘ We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we  weren’t talking any longer. I don’t know which of us hung  up with a sharp click but I know I didn’t care. I couldn’t  have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked  to her again in this world. I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line  was busy. I tried four times; finally an exasperated cen - tral told me the wire was being kept open for long distance  from Detroit. Taking out my time-table I drew a small circle  around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair  and tried to think. It was just noon. When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning  I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I sup - pose there’d be a curious crowd around there all day with  little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some  garrulous man telling over and over what had happened  until it became less and less real even to him and he could  tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was  forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what hap - pened at the garage after we left there the night before. They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She  must have broken her rule against drinking that night for  when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to  understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flush -1 coming. When they convinced her of this she immediately  fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Some - one kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the  wake of her sister’s body. Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up  against the front of the garage while George Wilson rocked  himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the  door of the office was open and everyone who came into the  garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said  it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and several  other men were with him—first four or five men, later two  or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last strang - er to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to  his own place and made a pot of coffee. After that he stayed  there alone with Wilson until dawn. About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent  muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk  about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of  finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he  blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come  from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen. But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and  began to cry ‘Oh, my God!’ again in his groaning voice. Mi - chaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him. ‘How long have you been married, George? Come on  there, try and sit still a minute and answer my question.  How long have you been married?’ ‘Twelve years.’ ‘Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I The Great Gatsby 1asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?’ The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull  light and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along  the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t  stopped a few hours before. He didn’t like to go into the ga - rage because the work bench was stained where the body  had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the of - fice—he knew every object in it before morning—and from  time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him  more quiet. ‘Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George?  Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time? May - be I could call up the church and get a priest to come over  and he could talk to you, see?’ ‘Don’t belong to any.’ ‘You ought to have a church, George, for times like this.  You must have gone to church once. Didn’t you get mar - ried in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn’t you get  married in a church?’ ‘That was a long time ago.’ The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking— for a moment he was silent. Then the same half knowing,  half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes. ‘Look in the drawer there,’ he said, pointing at the desk. ‘Which drawer?’ ‘That drawer—that one.’ Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There  was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of  leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.1 com‘This?’ he inquired, holding it up. Wilson stared and nodded. ‘I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about  it but I knew it was something funny.’ ‘You mean your wife bought it?’ ‘She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.’ Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that and he gave  Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the  dog leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these  same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began  saying ‘Oh, my God!’ again in a whisper—his comforter left  several explanations in the air. ‘Then he killed her,’ said Wilson. His mouth dropped  open suddenly. ‘Who did?’ ‘I have a way of finding out.’ ‘You’re morbid, George,’ said his friend. ‘This has been a  strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d  better try and sit quiet till morning.’ ‘He murdered her.’ ‘It was an accident, George.’ Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth  widened slightly with the ghost of a superior ‘Hm!’ ‘I know,’ he said definitely, ‘I’m one of these trusting fel - las and I don’t think any harm to NObody, but when I get to  know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran  out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.’ Michaelis had seen this too but it hadn’t occurred to him  that there was any special significance in it. He believed that The Great Gatsby 10Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband,  rather than trying to stop any particular car. ‘How could she of been like that?’ ‘She’s a deep one,’ said Wilson, as if that answered the  question. ‘Ah-h-h——‘ He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the  leash in his hand. ‘Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for,  George?’ This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson  had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He  was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room,  a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn  wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blue enough outside  to snap off the light. Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where  small grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here  and there in the faint dawn wind. ‘I spoke to her,’ he muttered, after a long silence. ‘I told  her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her  to the window—’ With an effort he got up and walked to  the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against  it, ‘—and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, ev - erything you’ve been doing. You may fool me but you can’t  fool God!’ ‘ Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he  was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had  just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night. ‘God sees everything,’ repeated Wilson.11 com‘That’s an advertisement,’ Michaelis assured him. Some - thing made him turn away from the window and look back  into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face  close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight. By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for  the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watch - ers of the night before who had promised to come back so  he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man  ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went  home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried  back to the garage Wilson was gone. His movements—he was on foot all the time—were af - terward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill  where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat and a cup  of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly for  he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far there was  no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys  who had seen a man ‘acting sort of crazy’ and motorists at  whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for  three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the  strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he ‘had a way of  finding out,’ supposed that he spent that time going from  garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On  the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came  forward—and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of find - ing out what he wanted to know. By half past two he was  in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s  house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name. At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left  The Great Gatsby 1word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be  brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a  pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the  summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he  gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out  under any circumstances—and this was strange because  the front right fender needed repair. Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.  Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur  asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a  moment disappeared among the yellowing trees. No telephone message arrived but the butler went with - out his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock—until long  after there was any one to give it to if it came. I have an idea  that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come and per - haps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt  that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for  living too long with a single dream. He must have looked  up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and  shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and  how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A  new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts,  breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about … like  that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the  amorphous trees. The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés— heard the shots—afterward he could only say that he hadn’t  thought anything much about them. I drove from the sta - tion directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously 1 comup the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one.  But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word  said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hur - ried down to the pool. There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the  water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward  the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly  the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly  down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugat - ed the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course  with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves  revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red  circle in the water. It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that  the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass,  and the holocaust was complete.The Great Gatsby 1Chapter 9 After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that  night and the next day, only as an endless drill of po - lice and photographers and newspaper men in and out of  Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretched across the main gate  and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys  soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and  there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed  about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps  a detective, used the expression ‘mad man’ as he bent over  Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious author - ity of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next  morning. Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, cir - cumstantial, eager and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony  at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife  I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy  pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything,  didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount of char - acter about it too—looked at the coroner with determined  eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her  sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely  happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no  mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it and cried  into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more 1 comthan she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man  ‘deranged by grief’ in order that the case might remain in  its simplest form. And it rested there. But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I  found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment  I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village,  every surmise about him, and every practical question, was  referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then,  as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak  hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, be - cause no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with  that intense personal interest to which every one has some  vague right at the end. I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called  her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom  had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with  them. ‘Left no address?’ ‘No.’ ‘Say when they’d be back?’ ‘No.’ ‘Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?’ ‘I don’t know. Can’t say.’ I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into  the room where he lay and reassure him: ‘I’ll get somebody  for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry. Just trust me and I’ll get some - body for you——‘ Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The  butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called The Great Gatsby 1Information, but by the time I had the number it was long  after five and no one answered the phone. ‘Will you ring again?’ ‘I’ve rung them three times.’ ‘It’s very important.’ ‘Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.’ I went back to the drawing room and thought for an in - stant that they were chance visitors, all these official people  who suddenly filled it. But as they drew back the sheet and  looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued  in my brain. ‘Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me.  You’ve got to try hard. I can’t go through this alone.’ Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away  and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked  parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his par - ents were dead. But there was nothing—only the picture of  Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from  the wall. Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter  to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him  to come out on the next train. That request seemed super - fluous when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when he saw the  newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy  before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived,  no one arrived except more police and photographers and  newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s  answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful soli - darity between Gatsby and me against them all.1 comDear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible  shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true  at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all  think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very  important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing  now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a  letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about  a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out. Yours truly   MEYER WOLFSHIEM  and then hasty addenda beneath: Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at  all.  When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance  said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at  last. But the connection came through as a man’s voice, very  thin and far away. ‘This is Slagle speaking....’ ‘Yes?’ The name was unfamiliar. ‘Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?’ ‘There haven’t been any wires.’ ‘Young Parke’s in trouble,’ he said rapidly. ‘They picked  him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They  got a circular from New York giving ‘em the numbers just  five minutes before. What d’you know about that, hey? You  never can tell in these hick towns——‘The Great Gatsby 1‘Hello!’ I interrupted breathlessly. ‘Look here—this isn’t  Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.’ There was a long silence on the other end of the wire,  followed by an exclamation … then a quick squawk as the  connection was broken. I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed  Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said  only that the sender was leaving immediately and to post - pone the funeral until he came. It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man very helpless  and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against  the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with  excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his  hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey  beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was  on the point of collapse so I took him into the music room  and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat.  But he wouldn’t eat and the glass of milk spilled from his  trembling hand. ‘I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,’ he said. ‘It was all in  the Chicago newspaper. I started right away.’ ‘I didn’t know how to reach you.’ His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the  room. ‘It was a mad man,’ he said. ‘He must have been mad.’ ‘Wouldn’t you like some coffee?’ I urged him. ‘I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.——‘ ‘Carraway.’ ‘Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?’1 comI took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and  left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps  and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had  arrived they went reluctantly away. After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came  out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leak - ing isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age  where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise,  and when he looked around him now for the first time and  saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms  opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be  mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom up - stairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all  arrangements had been deferred until he came. ‘I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby——‘ ‘Gatz is my name.’ ‘—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body  west.’ He shook his head. ‘Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his  position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?’ ‘We were close friends.’ ‘He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a  young man but he had a lot of brain power here.’ He touched his head impressively and I nodded. ‘If he’d of lived he’d of been a great man. A man like  James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.’ ‘That’s true,’ I said, uncomfortably. He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it The Great Gatsby 10from the bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep. That night an obviously frightened person called up  and demanded to know who I was before he would give his  name. ‘This is Mr. Carraway,’ I said. ‘Oh—’ He sounded relieved. ‘This is Klipspringer.’ I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another  friend at Gatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers  and draw a sightseeing crowd so I’d been calling up a few  people myself. They were hard to find. ‘The funeral’s tomorrow,’ I said. ‘Three o’clock, here at  the house. I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.’ ‘Oh, I will,’ he broke out hastily. ‘Of course I’m not likely  to see anybody, but if I do.’ His tone made me suspicious. ‘Of course you’ll be there yourself.’ ‘Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is——‘ ‘Wait a minute,’ I interrupted. ‘How about saying you’ll  come?’ ‘Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m stay - ing with some people up here in Greenwich and they rather  expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact there’s a sort  of picnic or something. Of course I’ll do my very best to get  away.’ I ejaculated an unrestrained ‘Huh!’ and he must have  heard me for he went on nervously: ‘What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I  wonder if it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send  them on. You see they’re tennis shoes and I’m sort of help -11 comless without them. My address is care of B. F.——‘ I didn’t hear the rest of the name because I hung up the  receiver. After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentle - man to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what  he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of  those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the cour - age of Gatsby’s liquor and I should have known better than  to call him. The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see  Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other  way. The door that I pushed open on the advice of an eleva - tor boy was marked ‘The Swastika Holding Company’ and  at first there didn’t seem to be any one inside. But when I’d  shouted ‘Hello’ several times in vain an argument broke out  behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared  at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile  eyes. ‘Nobody’s in,’ she said. ‘Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chica - go.’ The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone  had begun to whistle ‘The Rosary,’ tunelessly, inside. ‘Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.’ ‘I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?’ At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s called  ‘Stella!’ from the other side of the door. ‘Leave your name on the desk,’ she said quickly. ‘I’ll give  it to him when he gets back.’ ‘But I know he’s there.’The Great Gatsby 1She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands  indignantly up and down her hips. ‘You young men think you can force your way in here any  time,’ she scolded. ‘We’re getting sickantired of it. When I  say he’s in Chicago, he’s in ChiCAgo.’ I mentioned Gatsby. ‘Oh—h!’ She looked at me over again. ‘Will you just— what was your name?’ She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood sol - emnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me  into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad  time for all of us, and offered me a cigar. ‘My memory goes back to when I first met him,’ he said.  ‘A young major just out of the army and covered over with  medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep  on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some reg - ular clothes. First time I saw him was when he come into  Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked  for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come  on have some lunch with me,’ I sid. He ate more than four  dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.’ ‘Did you start him in business?’ I inquired. ‘Start him! I made him.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I  saw right away he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young  man, and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I  could use him good. I got him to join up in the American  Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did 1 comsome work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so  thick like that in everything—’ He held up two bulbous fin - gers ‘—always together.’ I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s  Series transaction in 1919. ‘Now he’s dead,’ I said after a moment. ‘You were his  closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral  this afternoon.’ ‘I’d like to come.’ ‘Well, come then.’ The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook  his head his eyes filled with tears. ‘I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.’ ‘When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in  it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was  different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck  with them to the end. You may think that’s sentimental but  I mean it—to the bitter end.’ I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined  not to come, so I stood up. ‘Are you a college man?’ he inquired suddenly. For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a ‘gon - negtion’ but he only nodded and shook my hand. ‘Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is  alive and not after he is dead,’ he suggested. ‘After that my  own rule is to let everything alone.’ When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got  back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I The Great Gatsby 1went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down  excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and in his son’s  possessions was continually increasing and now he had  something to show me. ‘Jimmy sent me this picture.’ He took out his wallet with  trembling fingers. ‘Look there.’ It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners  and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to  me eagerly. ‘Look there!’ and then sought admiration from  my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more  real to him now than the house itself. ‘Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It  shows up well.’ ‘Very well. Had you seen him lately?’ ‘He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the  house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run  off from home but I see now there was a reason for it. He  knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he  made a success he was very generous with me.’ He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for  another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he re - turned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old  copy of a book called ‘Hopalong Cassidy.’ ‘Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It  just shows you.’ He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for  me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHED - ULE, and the date September 12th, 1906.

He always had some re - solves like this or something. Do you notice what he’s got  about improving his mind? He was always great for that. He  told me I et like a hog once and I beat him for it.’ He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item  aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather ex - pected me to copy down the list for my own use. A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from  Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows  for other cars. So did Gatsby’s father. And as the time passed The Great Gatsby 1and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his  eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a  worried uncertain way. The minister glanced several times  at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for  half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came. About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached  the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the  gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr.  Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little  later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg  in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started  through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and  then the sound of someone splashing after us over the sog - gy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed  glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books  in the library one night three months before. I’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew  about the funeral or even his name. The rain poured down  his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see  the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave. I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he  was already too far away and I could only remember, with - out resentment, that Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower.  Dimly I heard someone murmur ‘Blessed are the dead that  the rain falls on,’ and then the owl-eyed man said ‘Amen to  that,’ in a brave voice. We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars.  Owl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate. ‘I couldn’t get to the house,’ he remarked.1 com‘Neither could anybody else.’ ‘Go on!’ He started. ‘Why, my God! they used to go there  by the hundreds.’ He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and  in. ‘The poor son-of-a-bitch,’ he said. One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west  from prep school and later from college at Christmas time.  Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the  old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening  with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own  holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the  fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That’s and  the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead  as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings  of invitations: ‘Are you going to the Ordways’? the Herseys’?  the Schultzes’?’ and the long green tickets clasped tight in  our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the  Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad looking cheerful  as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate. When we pulled out into the winter night and the real  snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle  against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin  stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into  the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back  from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware  of our identity with this country for one strange hour before  we melted indistinguishably into it again. That’s my middle west—not the wheat or the prairies or The Great Gatsby 1the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of  my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty  dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted  windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with  the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from grow - ing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are  still called through decades by a family’s name. I see now  that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and  Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and  perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which  made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life. Even when the East excited me most, even when I was  most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling,  swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable  inquisitions which spared only the children and the very  old—even then it had always for me a quality of distor - tion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic  dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred  houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching  under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In  the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking  along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken  woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles  over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men  turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the  woman’s name, and no one cares. After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like  that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction. So  when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and 1 comthe wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to  come back home. There was one thing to be done before I left, an awk - ward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been  let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just  trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse  away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what  had happened to us together and what had happened af - terward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big  chair. She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking  she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little,  jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the  same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When  I had finished she told me without comment that she was  engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were  several she could have married at a nod of her head but I  pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if  I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again  quickly and got up to say goodbye. ‘Nevertheless you did throw me over,’ said Jordan sud - denly. ‘You threw me over on the telephone. I don’t give a  damn about you now but it was a new experience for me  and I felt a little dizzy for a while.’ We shook hands. ‘Oh, and do you remember—’ she added, ‘——a conver - sation we had once about driving a car?’ ‘Why—not exactly.’ ‘You said a bad driver was only safe until she met an -The Great Gatsby 10other bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I?  I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I  thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person.  I thought it was your secret pride.’ ‘I’m thirty,’ I said. ‘I’m five years too old to lie to myself  and call it honor.’ She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and  tremendously sorry, I turned away. One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He  was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert,  aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to  fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and  there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up  to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning  into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me  and walked back holding out his hand. ‘What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands  with me?’ ‘Yes. You know what I think of you.’ ‘You’re crazy, Nick,’ he said quickly. ‘Crazy as hell. I don’t  know what’s the matter with you.’ ‘Tom,’ I inquired, ‘what did you say to Wilson that af - ternoon?’ He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed  right about those missing hours. I started to turn away but  he took a step after me and grabbed my arm. ‘I told him the truth,’ he said. ‘He came to the door while  we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word  that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was 11 comcrazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the  car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute  he was in the house——’ He broke off defiantly. ‘What if I  did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw  dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s but he was a  tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and  never even stopped his car.’ There was nothing I could say, except the one unutter - able fact that it wasn’t true. ‘And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering— look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that  damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat  down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful——‘ I couldn’t forgive him or like him but I saw that what  he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very  careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and  Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then re - treated back into their money or their vast carelessness or  whatever it was that kept them together, and let other peo - ple clean up the mess they had made…. I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt  suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went  into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps  only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squea - mishness forever. Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on  his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi driv - ers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate  without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps The Great Gatsby 1it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the  night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about  it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him  when I got off the train. I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those  gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly  that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and  incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down  his drive. One night I did hear a material car there and saw  its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn’t investigate.  Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the  ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over. On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold  to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent  failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene  word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out  clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe  raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the  beach and sprawled out on the sand. Most of the big shore places were closed now and there  were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of  a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher  the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I  became aware of the old island here that flowered once for  Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world.  Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gats - by’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and  greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted  moment man must have held his breath in the presence of 1 comthis continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation  he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last  time in history with something commensurate to his capac - ity for wonder. And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world,  I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the  green light at the end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long  way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so  close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know  that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast  obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the re - public rolled on under the night. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future  that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but  that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out  our arms farther…. And one fine morning—— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back  ceaselessly into the past. THE END
