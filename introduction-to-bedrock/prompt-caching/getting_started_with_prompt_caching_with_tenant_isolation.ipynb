    "# Prompt Caching in Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching is a powerful feature in Amazon Bedrock that significantly reduces response latency for workloads with repetitive contexts. This notebook demonstrates how to implement prompt caching effectively for document-based chat applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Prompt Caching?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching allows you to store portions of your conversation context, enabling models to:\n",
    "- Reuse cached context instead of reprocessing inputs\n",
    "- Reduce response Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for subsequent queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Prompt Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching delivers maximum benefits for:\n",
    "- **Chat with Document**: By caching the document as input context on the first request, each user query becomes more efficient, perhaps enabling simpler architectures that avoid heavier solutions like vector databases.\n",
    "- **Coding assistants**: Reusing long code files in prompts enables near real-time inline suggestions, eliminating much of the time spent reprocessing code files.\n",
    "- **Agentic workflows**: Longer system prompts can be used to refine agent behavior without degrading the end-user experience. By caching the system prompts and complex tool definitions, the time to process each step in the agentic flow can be reduced.\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Learning**: Including numerous high-quality examples and complex instructions, such as for customer service or technical troubleshooting, can benefit from prompt caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Prompt Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Response Times**: Avoid reprocessing the same context repeatedly\n",
    "- **Improved User Experience**: Reduced TTFT to create more natural conversations\n",
    "- **Cost Efficiency**: Potentially lower token usage by avoiding redundant processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through a document-based chat implementation using prompt caching to demonstrate:\n",
    "1. How to properly structure cache points in your requests\n",
    "2. Performance comparisons with and without caching\n",
    "3. Best practices for cache management\n",
    "4. Measuring and optimizing cache effectiveness\n",

    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n1. Identifying Relevant Quotes:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Carefully read through the entire document.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Identify sections of the text that are directly relevant to answering the question.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Select quotes that provide key information, context, or support for the answer.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Quotes should be concise and to the point, typically no more than 2-3 sentences each.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Choose a diverse range of quotes if multiple aspects of the question need to be addressed.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Aim to select between 2 to 5 quotes, depending on the complexity of the question.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n2. Presenting the Quotes:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - List the selected quotes under the heading 'Relevant quotes:'\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Number each quote sequentially, starting from [1].\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Present each quote exactly as it appears in the original text, enclosed in quotation marks.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - If no relevant quotes can be found, write 'No relevant quotes' instead.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Example format:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n     Relevant quotes:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n     [1] \\\"This is the first relevant quote from the document.\\\"\"\n",
    "    \"\\n     [2] \\\"This is the second relevant quote from the document.\\\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n3. Formulating the Answer:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Begin your answer with the heading 'Answer:' on a new line after the quotes.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Provide a clear, concise, and accurate answer to the question based on the information in the document.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Ensure your answer is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the question.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Use information from the quotes to support your answer, but do not repeat them verbatim.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Maintain a logical flow and structure in your response.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Use clear and simple language, avoiding jargon unless it's necessary and explained.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n4. Referencing Quotes in the Answer:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Do not explicitly mention or introduce quotes in your answer (e.g., avoid phrases like 'According to quote [1]').\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Instead, add the bracketed number of the relevant quote at the end of each sentence or point that uses information from that quote.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - If a sentence or point is supported by multiple quotes, include all relevant quote numbers.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Example: 'The company's revenue grew by 15% last year. [1] This growth was primarily driven by increased sales in the Asian market. [2][3]'\"\n",

    "    \"\\n\\n5. Handling Uncertainty or Lack of Information:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - If the document does not contain enough information to fully answer the question, clearly state this in your answer.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Provide any partial information that is available, and explain what additional information would be needed to give a complete answer.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - If there are multiple possible interpretations of the question or the document's content, explain this and provide answers for each interpretation if possible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n6. Maintaining Objectivity:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Stick to the facts presented in the document. Do not include personal opinions or external information not found in the text.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - If the document presents biased or controversial information, note this objectively in your answer without endorsing or refuting the claims.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n7. Formatting and Style:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Use clear paragraph breaks to separate different points or aspects of your answer.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Employ bullet points or numbered lists if it helps to organize information more clearly.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Ensure proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling throughout your response.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Maintain a professional and neutral tone throughout your answer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n8. Length and Depth:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Provide an answer that is sufficiently detailed to address the question comprehensively.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - However, avoid unnecessary verbosity. Aim for clarity and conciseness.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - The length of your answer should be proportional to the complexity of the question and the amount of relevant information in the document.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n9. Dealing with Complex or Multi-part Questions:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - For questions with multiple parts, address each part separately and clearly.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Use subheadings or numbered points to break down your answer if necessary.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n   - Ensure that you've addressed all aspects of the question in your response.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"\\n\\n10. Concluding the Answer:\"\n",
    "    \"\\n    - If appropriate, provide a brief conclusion that summarizes the key points of your answer.\"\n",
    "    \"\\n    - If the question asks for recommendations or future implications, include these based strictly on the information provided in the document.\"\n",
