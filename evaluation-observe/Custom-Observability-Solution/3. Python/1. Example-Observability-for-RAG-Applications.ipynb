    "# Observability and human feedback collection for a RAG application using knowledge bases for Amazon bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context:\n",
    "In the following example, we will use a `Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock` that you have already created and add the request and response to an `Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose`. The Amazon Firehose will then apply a transformation on the data to flatten the nested JSON and created logical partitions in the data using `call_type` variable, which will ease data usage later when you query it in a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data transformation takes place using a `Transformation Lambda function` associated with the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. This configuration allows for data transformation without adding any latency to your application due to the transformation step. You can optionally disable the data flattening in the Amazon lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "After successfully setting up the backend resources required using the provided `CloudFormation template` to gather necessary data on user requests, your custom metadata like latency, time to first token, tags, model responses, citations, and any other custom identifiers you would like to add (e.g., user_id/customer_id), you can now test if your observability architecture is working as expected and determine the latency introduced by adding this additional component to your application."

    "\n",
    "In the below section, we will go through the code that interacts with the Knowledge Base for Amazon Bedrock to retrieve and generate responses based on user questions. The code imports necessary libraries and modules, including the AWS SDK (boto3) and the observability custom module called `observability` that contains the `BedrockLogs` class for logging, evaluation, and observability purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It sets up AWS clients for Firehose, Bedrock Agent Runtime, and a boto3 session, and imports configuration values from a separate `config` module. The `retrieve_and_generate` function is defined, which takes a question and parameters as input, and calls the `bedrock_agent_runtime_client.retrieve_and_generate` method to retrieve and generate a response from the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base based on the provided question and configuration parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `main` function is decorated with `@bedrock_logs.watch`, which logs and tracks the function call for observability purposes. `@bedrock_logs.watch` tracks first input argument, so, you can choose to pass a JSON and add any metadata according to your use case and the observability solution will track it. Similarly, the observability solution will also track all the return varaiable values. You can also log any custom metric like time to first token, time to last token, or any other custom metric of your choosing inside the decorated function and add it to the return statement so that it gets logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `main` function, the `retrieve_and_generate` function is called with the user's question and generation configuration parameters. The response from the Knowledge Base is stored in the `application_metadata` dictionary, along with the generation parameters, and the generated response text is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code also includes a helper function `generate_web_session_id` to generate a random session ID, which can be used as a custom identifier for tracking purposes."

    "\n",
    "In this section, you are using the `run_id` and `observation_id` generated from the `main function` to collect feedback on the responses from your end-users or QA team. The code defines two functions, `observation_level_feedback` and `session_level_feedback`, both decorated with `@bedrock_logs.watch` to track the feedback collection process.\n",

This allows you to separate the feedback data based on whether it is collected at the observation level or the session level, making it easier to analyze and process the feedback data later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `observation_level_feedback` function is designed to collect feedback at the observation level, which means feedback is associated with a specific `observation_id`. This function takes a dictionary as input, containing the `user_id`, `f_run_id` (the run_id associated with the feedback), `f_observation_id` (the observation_id associated with the feedback), and `actual_feedback` (the feedback itself, which can be a simple \"Thumbs-up\" or more detailed text).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `session_level_feedback` function is designed to collect feedback at the session level, which means feedback is associated with a specific `run_id`. The input parameters for this function are not provided in the code snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the feedback mechanism, it is crucial to always pass the `run_id` and `observation_id` for which the feedback is being collected like we did with `f_run_id` and `observation_id`. These identifiers act as keys for joining various logically partitioned datasets, allowing you to associate the feedback with the specific response generated by your GenAI application.\n",

    "The code demonstrates how the `observation_level_feedback` function can be called with a dictionary containing the necessary information, including a dummy `user_feedback` value of \"Thumbs-up\".\n",
    "\n",
    "By collecting feedback at the observation or session level and using the `call_type` variable to create logical partitions, you can effectively organize and analyze the feedback data, enabling you to evaluate the performance and quality of the responses, identify areas for improvement, and refine the knowledge base or model accordingly."
