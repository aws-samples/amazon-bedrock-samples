    "# Amazon Bedrock Recipe: Langfuse Integration with Bedrock Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This recipe implements an OpenTelemetry-based tracing and monitoring system for Amazon Bedrock Agents through Langfuse integration. It creates hierarchical trace structures to track agent performance metrics including token usage, latency measurements, and execution durations across preprocessing, orchestration, and postprocessing phases. It processes both streaming and non-streaming responses, generating spans with operation attributes such as timing data, error states, and response content. The error handling and logging functions enable systematic debugging, performance monitoring, and audit trail maintenance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Langfuse integration enables tracing, monitoring, and analyzing the performance and behavior of your Bedrock Agents. This helps in understanding agent interactions, debugging issues, and optimizing performance and can be used with single agents, multi-agent collaboration (MAC), or with inline agents. When using Langfuse you can utilize the cloud platform or a self hosted option on a container. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Case\n",
    "To demonstrate the integration between Langfuse and Amazon Bedrock Agents providing observability outside of AWS tooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "In this notebook we will show how to integrate Amazon Bedrock Agents and Langfuse using both the Langfuse cloud platform and self-hosted option in a container running in AWS. We will configure agent observability, send traces to Langfuse, and validate the results using a single agent.\n"
