    "# Agent Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore the evaluation of agentic systems. Agentic systems are complex constructs consisting of multiple sub-components. In Lab 3, we examined a simple singleton agent orchestrating between two tools. Lab 4 demonstrated a more sophisticated multi-layer agentic system with a top-level router agent coordinating multiple agentic sub-systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One direct implication of the interdependent and potentially nested nature of agentic systems is that evaluation can occur at both macro and micro levels. This means that either the entire system as a whole is being evaluated (macro view) or each individual sub-component is assessed (micro view). For nested systems, this applies to every level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, evaluation begins at the macro level. In many cases, positive evaluation results at the macro level indicate sufficient agent performance. If macro-level performance evaluation proves insufficient or yields poor results, micro-level evaluation can help decompose the performance metrics and attribute results to specific sub-components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will first explore macro-level agent performance evaluation. Then, we will evaluate tool usage as a lower-level task. To maintain focus on the evaluation process, we will keep the agentic system simple by utilizing the singleton agent composed in Lab 3."

    "As covered in the previous section, we will reuse the Agent we built in Lab 3. This agent has access to tools designed to help find vacation destinations. You'll be able to interact with the agent by asking questions, observe it utilizing various tools, and engage in meaningful conversations.\n",

    "## Agent Evaluation with ragas library \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore sophisticated methods for evaluating agentic systems using the ragas library. Building upon our previous work with the vacation destination agent from Lab 3, we'll implement both high-level (macro) and low-level (micro) evaluation approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "ragas provides specialized tools for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications, with particular emphasis on agentic systems. We'll focus on two key evaluation dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [High-Level Agent Accuracy](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/agents/#agent-goal-accuracy):\n",
    "   - Agent Goal Accuracy (with reference): Measures how well the agent achieves specified goals by comparing outcomes against annotated reference responses\n",
    "   - Agent Goal Accuracy (without reference): Evaluates goal achievement by inferring desired outcomes from user interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Low-Level Tool Usage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/agents/#tool-call-accuracy):\n",
    "   - Tool Call Accuracy: Assesses the agent's ability to identify and utilize appropriate tools by comparing actual tool calls against reference tool calls\n",
    "   - The metric ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured evaluation approach allows us to comprehensively assess our vacation destination agent's performance, both at the system level and the component level. By maintaining our focus on the singleton agent from Lab 3, we can clearly demonstrate these evaluation techniques without the added complexity of nested agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's proceed with implementing these evaluation methods to analyze our agent's effectiveness in handling vacation-related queries and tool interactions."

    "### Util functions part 2 - Message Format Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Our singleton agent is built using the LangChain/LangGraph framework. LangChain defines several [message objects](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/chat/message_types/) to handle different types of communication within an agentic system. According to the LangChain documentation, these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HumanMessage: This represents a message from the user. Generally consists only of content.\n",
    "- AIMessage: This represents a message from the model. This may have additional_kwargs in it - for example tool_calls if using Amazon Bedrock tool calling.\n",
    "- ToolMessage: This represents the result of a tool call. In addition to role and content, this message has a `tool_call_id` parameter which conveys the id of the call to the tool that was called to produce this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the ragas library implements its own message wrapper objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [HumanMessage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/evaluation_schema/?h=aimessage#ragas.messages.HumanMessage): Represents a message from a human user.\n",
    "- [AIMessage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/evaluation_schema/?h=aimessage#ragas.messages.AIMessage): Represents a message from an AI.\n",
    "- [ToolMessage](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/evaluation_schema/?h=aimessage#ragas.messages.ToolMessage): Represents a message from a tool.\n",
    "- [ToolCall](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/references/evaluation_schema/?h=aimessage#ragas.messages.ToolCall):  Represents a tool invocation with name and arguments (typically contained within an `AIMessage` when tool calling is used)\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the conversation flow generated by the LangGraph agent, we need to convert between these two message type systems. For convenience, we've implemented the `convert_message_langchian_to_ragas` function in the `utils.py` module. This function handles the conversion process seamlessly. You can import it along with the message wrapper objects, which are assigned appropriate aliases to ensure cross-compatibility between the frameworks."

       " AIMessage(content=\"There could be a few reasons why your beer is tasting bitter:\\n\\n1. Hop Bitterness\\nHops are one of the main ingredients in beer that provide bitterness. Different hop varieties and amounts used can make beers range from lightly bitter to intensely bitter and piney/citrusy. Heavily hopped styles like IPAs, pale ales, and some lagers will naturally have a more pronounced bitterness.\\n\\n2. Roasted Malts\\nDarker roasted malts used in stouts, porters, and some lagers can also contribute bitter, burnt, or coffee-like bitter flavors to beer.\\n\\n3. Off-Flavors\\nIf the bitterness seems harsh or unpleasant, it could be from off-flavors caused by bacteria, wild yeasts, oxidation, or age. Skunky, solvent-like, or overly astringent bitterness is often a sign of a flaw rather than intended hop/malt bitterness.\\n\\n4. Your Palate\\nSome people are more sensitive to bitterness from hops and malts than others based on their tastebuds. If you're unused to bitter beer styles, the bitterness may seem exaggerated at first.\\n\\nIf you're trying a locally-brewed beer in Miami, keep in mind that many Florida breweries use abundant hops (especially citrusy American varieties) that can make the beers quite bitter and hoppy in character. Don't be afraid to ask your server about the beer style and what's contributing the bitterness you're tasting. With a little guidance, you can find the right amount of hop bitterness that suits your palate preference.\", metadata={'input_tokens': 2379, 'output_tokens': 374, 'total_tokens': 2753}, type='ai', tool_calls=[])]"

This metric needs user_input and reference_tool_calls to evaluate the performance of the LLM in identifying and calling the required tools to complete a given task. The metric is computed by comparing the reference_tool_calls with the Tool calls made by the AI. Therefore, in this particular scenario, there is no need for an evaluator LLM.

This evaluation requires a set of annotated reference tool calls that serve as a benchmark for assessment. Next, we initialize a `ToolCallAccuracy` object to implement our evaluation metric. While the default behavior compares tool names and arguments using exact string matching, this may not always be optimal, particularly when dealing with natural language arguments. To mitigate this, ragas provides us with a choice of different NLP distance metrics we can employ to determine the relevance of retrieved contexts more effectively. In this lab we use `NonLLMStringSimilarity`, which is leveraging traditional string distance measures such as Levenshtein, Hamming, and Jaro. Therefore, we set the parameter `arg_comparison_metric` to `NonLLMStringSimilarity`."

    "Let's analyze the results and their relationship to each persona's interaction patterns with the agent. We encourage you to discuss these findings with your workshop group to gain deeper insights. Keep in mind that agent conversations are dynamic and non-deterministic, meaning evaluation results may vary across different runs.\n",

    "- Stephen's conversations typically achieve a very high rating due to his focused and goal-oriented approach and the fact that he can be found in the travel database - this helps matching all tool call arguments\n",
    "- Jane's conversations typically achieve a high but slightly lower rating. While her conversation is focused and goal-oriented, she is not in the travel database. This causes the first tool call suggestions to be less deterministic, reducing the likelihood of Florida-based recommendations\n",
    "- Homer's interactions achieve very low scores since they are characterized by chaotic and divergent patterns. This makes it highly unlikely to match the correct tool call sequence"
