# Dream Destination Finder with CrewAI and Amazon Bedrock

In this notebook, we will explore how to use the CrewAI framework with Amazon Bedrock to build an intelligent agent that can find dream travel destinations based on user preferences. The agent will utilize a large language model (LLM) and web search capabilities to research and recommend destinations that match the user's description.

## What's CrewAI:
CrewAI is one of the leading open-source Python frameworks designed to help developers create and manage multi-agent AI systems.

__!pip install boto3 botocore crewai crewai_tools duckduckgo-search langchain-community -q__

We start by importing the necessary modules from the crewai and crewai_tools packages.

#### Configuring AWS Credentials:
Before using Amazon Bedrock, ensure that your AWS credentials are configured correctly. You can set them up using the AWS CLI or by setting environment variables. For this notebook, we‚Äôll assume that the credentials are already configured.

To use bedrock we will use [__CrewAI__ __LLM__ api](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/llm-connections#supported-providers) 


```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM
from crewai_tools import tool
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
```

#### Define web-search tool:


```python
@tool('DuckDuckGoSearch')
def search(search_query: str):
    """Search the web for information on a given topic"""
    return DuckDuckGoSearchRun().run(search_query)
```

### Configuring the LLM

We will use Anthropic‚Äôs Claude-3 model via Amazon Bedrock as our LLM. CrewAI uses LiteLLM under the hood to interact with different LLM providers.



```python
# Configure the LLM
llm = LLM(model="bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0")
```

### Defining the Agent

We will create an agent with the role of a ‚ÄúTravel Destination Researcher.‚Äù This agent will be responsible for finding destinations that match the user‚Äôs travel preferences.


```python
# Define the Agent
travel_agent = Agent(
    role='Travel Destination Researcher',
    goal='Find dream destinations matching user preferences',
    backstory="You are an experienced travel agent specializing in personalized travel recommendations.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm,
    tools=[search]  # Tool for online searching
)
```

### Defining the Task

We need to specify the task that the agent will perform. The task includes a description, expected output, and is assigned to the agent we just created.


```python
# Define the Task
task = Task(
    description="Based on the user's travel preferences: {preferences}, research and recommend suitable travel destinations.",
    expected_output="A list of recommended destinations with brief descriptions.",
    agent=travel_agent
)
```

### Creating the Crew

A crew is a team of agents working together to achieve a common goal. In this case, we have only one agent, but the framework allows for scalability.



```python
# Create the Crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[travel_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
)
```

    2024-10-15 11:34:01,412 - 8603045696 - __init__.py-__init__:538 - WARNING: Overriding of current TracerProvider is not allowed


### Executing the Workflow

Now, we can execute the crew with the user‚Äôs travel preferences as input.


```python
# User input for travel preferences
user_input = {
    "preferences": "I want a tropical beach vacation with great snorkeling and vibrant nightlife."
}

# Execute the Crew
result = crew.kickoff(inputs=user_input)
```

### Adding Memory to the Agent
CrewAI supports [several memory types](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/memory#implementing-memory-in-your-crew), which help agents remember and learn from past interactions. In this case, we‚Äôll enable short-term memory using Amazon Bedrock‚Äôs embedding model.


```python
# Enabling Memory in the Agent
crew_with_memory = Crew(
    agents=[travel_agent],
    tasks=[task],

### Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base
In this section, we will enhance our dream destination finder agent by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Amazon Bedrock‚Äôs Knowledge Base. This will allow our agent to access up-to-date and domain-specific travel information, improving the accuracy and relevance of its recommendations.



#### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

RAG is a technique that combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant information from external data sources. By integrating RAG, our agent can retrieve the most recent and specific information from a knowledge base, overcoming the limitations of LLMs that may have outdated or insufficient data.

Setting Up Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base

Before we proceed, ensure you have access to Amazon Bedrock and the necessary permissions to create and manage knowledge bases.

* Step 1: Prepare Your Data
* Step 2: Create a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock
* Step 3: Note the Knowledge Base ID

After the knowledge base is created, note down its Knowledge Base ID (kb_id), which will be used in our code.

<img src="./assets/KB-pannel.png">

Updating the Agent to Use RAG with CrewAI

We will modify our agent to include a custom tool that queries the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base. This allows the agent to retrieve up-to-date information during its reasoning process.


```python
import boto3
# Initialize the Bedrock client
bedrock_agent_runtime_client = boto3.client("bedrock-agent-runtime", region_name="{YOUR-REGION}")
```

### Knowledge Base Tool Set up:
Using the __kb id__, __model arn__ (either foundational or custom) we can leverage Amazons Knowledge Bases. In this example the question will also be broken down using __orchestrationConfiguration__ settings.


```python
@tool("TravelExpertSearchEngine")
def query_knowledge_base(question: str) -> str:
    """Queries the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base for travel-related information."""
    kb_id = "XXXX"  # Replace with your Knowledge Base ID
    model_id = "foundation-model/anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"   # Use an available model in Bedrock
    model_arn = f'arn:aws:bedrock:YOUR-REGION::{model_id}'

    response = bedrock_agent_runtime_client.retrieve_and_generate(
        input={'text': question},
        retrieveAndGenerateConfiguration={
            "type": "KNOWLEDGE_BASE",
            "knowledgeBaseConfiguration" : {'knowledgeBaseId': kb_id,
                                    'modelArn': model_arn,
                                    'orchestrationConfiguration': {
                                        'queryTransformationConfiguration': {
                                            'type': 'QUERY_DECOMPOSITION'
                                        }
                                    }
                                            }
        }
    )
    try:
        return str({"Results": response['output']['text'], "Citations": response['citations'][0]})
    except KeyError:
        return "No data available"


```

### Update the Agent with the New Tool
We will update our agent to include the TravelExpert tool.


```python
# Configure the LLM

However, the information doesn't specifically mention rodeo events in Dallas. Kansas City was also mentioned but doesn't appear as strong of a match for cowboy vibes. To make a more comprehensive recommendation, I should look into other cities known for hosting major rodeo events.[00m

    Based on your interests in cowboy culture, rodeos, and museums, I would recommend traveling to the Dallas, Texas area. Dallas has a thriving honky-tonk bar scene in the Deep Ellum neighborhood that celebrates its cowboy heritage and allows you to experience authentic cowboy vibes. 
    
    While major rodeo events were not specifically mentioned in the search results, Dallas likely hosts or has access to rodeos given its location and ties to western culture. The city also has the Sixth Floor Museum which chronicles the life and assassination of President John F. Kennedy, providing an opportunity to learn about an important event in American history.
    
    Some potential activities in the Dallas area could include:
    
    - Visiting authentic honky-tonk bars like The Lil' Red Saloon in Deep Ellum to experience live country music and a cowboy atmosphere
    - Seeing exhibits on the history of the American West at the Sixth Floor Museum 
    - Attending rodeo events or visiting the Fort Worth Stockyards historic district just outside Dallas to watch cattle drives and see cowboy culture
    - Exploring outdoor activities like horseback riding at nearby ranches or state parks
    - Checking out the Nasher Sculpture Center or other museums in the Dallas Arts District
    
    With its blend of cowboy heritage, history museums, and proximity to rodeos and outdoor adventures, the Dallas metro area could make an excellent travel destination aligning with your stated interests. Let me know if you need any other details to plan your cowboy/rodeo themed travels![00m
