Findings can be shared through explainability reports."
What kind of bias does SageMaker Clarify detect?," Measuring bias in ML models is a first step to mitigating bias. Bias may be measured before training and after training, as well as for inference for a deployed model. Each measure of bias corresponds to a different notion of fairness. Even considering simple notions of fairness leads to many different measures applicable in various contexts. You must choose bias notions and metrics that are valid for the application and the situation under investigation. SageMaker currently supports the computation of different bias metrics for training data (as part of SageMaker data preparation), for the trained model (as part of Amazon SageMaker Experiments), and for inference for a deployed model (as part of Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor). For example, before training, we provide metrics for checking whether the training data is representative (that is, whether one group is underrepresented) and whether there are differences in the label distribution across groups. After training or during deployment, metrics can be helpful to measure whether (and by how much) the performance of the model differs across groups. For example, start by comparing the error rates (how likely a model's prediction is to differ from the true label) or break further down into precision (how likely a positive prediction is to be correct) and recall (how likely the model will correctly label a positive example)."
How does SageMaker Clarify improve model explainability?, SageMaker Clarify is integrated with SageMaker Experiments to provide a feature importance graph detailing the importance of each input for your modelâ€™s overall decision-making process after the model has been trained.

You can browse and import data using the SageMaker Canvas visual drag-and-drop interface. Additionally, you can drag and drop files from your local disk, and use pre-built connectors to import data from third-party sources such as Snowflake."
How do I build an ML model to generate accurate predictions in SageMaker Canvas?," Once you have connected sources, selected a dataset, and prepared your data, you can select the target column that you want to predict to initiate a model creation job. SageMaker Canvas will automatically identify the problem type, generate new relevant features, test a comprehensive set of prediction models using ML techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, deep learning, time-series forecasting, and gradient boosting, and build the model that makes accurate predictions based on your dataset."
How long does it take to build a model in SageMaker Canvas? How can I monitor progress during model creation?," The time it takes to build a model depends on the size of your dataset. Small datasets can take less than 30 minutes, and large datasets can take a few hours. As the model creation job progresses, SageMaker Canvas provides detailed visual updates, including percent job complete and the amount of time left for job completion."
What is Amazon SageMaker Experiments?," SageMaker Experiments helps you organize and track iterations to ML models. SageMaker Experiments helps you manage iterations by automatically capturing the input parameters, configurations, and results, and storing them as experiments. You can work within the visual interface of SageMaker Studio, where you can browse active experiments, search for previous experiments by their characteristics, review previous experiments with their results, and compare experiment results visually."
What is Amazon SageMaker Debugger?,"  SageMaker Debugger automatically captures real-time metrics during training, such as confusion matrices and learning gradients, to help improve model accuracy. The metrics from SageMaker Debugger can be visualized in SageMaker Studio for easy understanding. SageMaker Debugger can also generate warnings and remediation advice when common training problems are detected. SageMaker Debugger also automatically monitors and profiles system resources such as CPUs, GPUs, network, and memory in real time, and provides recommendations on re-allocation of these resources. This helps you use your resources efficiently during training and helps reduce costs and resources."
Does SageMaker support distributed training?," Yes. SageMaker can automatically distribute deep learning models and large training sets across AWS GPU instances in a fraction of the time it takes to build and optimize these distribution strategies manually. The two distributed training techniques that SageMaker applies are data parallelism and model parallelism. Data parallelism is applied to improve training speeds by dividing the data equally across multiple GPU instances, allowing each instance to train concurrently. Model parallelism is useful for models too large to be stored on a single GPU and require the model to be partitioned into smaller parts before distributing across multiple GPUs. With only a few lines of additional code in your PyTorch and TensorFlow training scripts, SageMaker will automatically apply data parallelism or model parallelism for you, allowing you to develop and deploy your models faster. SageMaker will determine the best approach to split your model by using graph partitioning algorithms to balance the computation of each GPU while minimizing the communication between GPU instances. SageMaker also optimizes your distributed training jobs through algorithms that fully utilize the AWS compute and network in order to achieve near-linear scaling efficiency, which allows you to complete training faster than manual open-source implementations."
What is Amazon SageMaker Training Compiler?," SageMaker Training Compiler is a deep learning (DL) compiler that accelerates DL model training by up to 50 percent through graph- and kernel-level optimizations to use GPUs more efficiently. SageMaker Training Compiler is integrated with versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch in SageMaker, so you can speed up training in these popular frameworks with minimal code changes."
How does SageMaker Training Compiler work?," SageMaker Training Compiler accelerates training jobs by converting DL models from their high-level language representation to hardware-optimized instructions that train faster than jobs with the native frameworks. More specifically, SageMaker Training Compiler uses graph-level optimization (operator fusion, memory planning, and algebraic simplification), data flow-level optimizations (layout transformation, common sub-expression elimination), and backend optimizations (memory latency hiding, loop oriented optimizations) to produce an optimized model training job that more efficiently uses hardware resources and, as a result, trains faster."
How can I use SageMaker Training Compiler?," SageMaker Training Compiler is built into the SageMaker Python SDK and SageMaker Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers. You donâ€™t need to change your workflows to access its speedup benefits. You can run training jobs in the same way as you already do, using any of the SageMaker interfaces: SageMaker notebook instances, SageMaker Studio, AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). You can enable SageMaker Training Compiler by adding a TrainingCompilerConfig class as a parameter when you create a framework estimator object. Practically, this means a couple of lines of code added to your existing training job script for a single GPU instance. Most up-to-date detailed documentation, sample notebooks, and examples are available in the documentation."
What is the pricing of SageMaker Training Compiler? , SageMaker Training Compiler is a SageMaker Training feature and is provided at no additional charge exclusively to SageMaker customers. Customers can actually reduce their costs with SageMaker Training Compiler as training times are reduced.
What is Managed Spot Training?," Managed Spot Training with SageMaker lets you train your ML models using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, while reducing the cost of training your models by up to 90%."
How do I use Managed Spot Training?," You enable the Managed Spot Training option when submitting your training jobs and you also specify how long you want to wait for Spot capacity. SageMaker will then use Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to run your job and manages the Spot capacity. You have full visibility into the status of your training jobs, both while they are running and while they are waiting for capacity."
When should I use Managed Spot Training?," Managed Spot Training is ideal when you have flexibility with your training runs and when you want to minimize the cost of your training jobs. With Managed Spot Training, you can reduce the cost of training your ML models by up to 90%."
How does Managed Spot Training work?," Managed Spot Training uses Amazon EC2 Spot Instances for training, and these instances can be pre-empted when AWS needs capacity. As a result, Managed Spot Training jobs can run in small increments as and when capacity becomes available. The training jobs need not be restarted from scratch when there is an interruption, as SageMaker can resume the training jobs using the latest model checkpoint. The built-in frameworks and the built-in computer vision algorithms with SageMaker enable periodic checkpoints, and you can enable checkpoints with custom models."
Do I need to periodically checkpoint with Managed Spot Training?," We recommend periodic checkpoints as a general best practice for long-running training jobs. This prevents your Managed Spot Training jobs from restarting if capacity is pre-empted. When you enable checkpoints, SageMaker resumes your Managed Spot Training jobs from the last checkpoint."
How do you calculate the cost savings with Managed Spot Training jobs?," Once a Managed Spot Training job is completed, you can see the savings in the AWS Management Console and also calculate the cost savings as the percentage difference between the duration for which the training job ran and the duration for which you were billed. Regardless of how many times your Managed Spot Training jobs are interrupted, you are charged only once for the duration for which the data was downloaded."
Which instances can I use with Managed Spot Training?, Managed Spot Training can be used with all instances supported in SageMaker.
Which Regions are supported with Managed Spot Training?, Managed Spot Training is supported in all Regions where SageMaker is currently available.
Are there limits to the size of the dataset I can use for training?, There are no fixed limits to the size of the dataset you can use for training models with SageMaker.
What algorithms does SageMaker use to generate models?," SageMaker includes built-in algorithms for linear regression, logistic regression, k-means clustering, principal component analysis, factorization machines, neural topic modeling, latent dirichlet allocation, gradient boosted trees, sequence2sequence, time-series forecasting, word2vec, and image classification. SageMaker also provides optimized Apache MXNet, Tensorflow, Chainer, PyTorch, Gluon, Keras, Horovod, Scikit-learn, and Deep Graph Library containers. In addition, SageMaker supports your custom training algorithms provided through a Docker image adhering to the documented specification."
What is Automatic Model Tuning?, Most ML algorithms expose a variety of parameters that control how the underlying algorithm operates. Those parameters are generally referred to as hyperparameters and their values affect the quality of the trained models. Automatic model tuning is the process of finding a set of hyperparameters for an algorithm that can yield an optimal model.
What models can be tuned with Automatic Model Tuning?," You can run automatic model tuning in SageMaker on top of any algorithm as long as itâ€™s scientifically feasible, including built-in SageMaker algorithms, deep neural networks, or arbitrary algorithms you bring to SageMaker in the form of Docker images."
Can I use Automatic Model Tuning outside SageMaker?, Not at this time. The best model tuning performance and experience is within SageMaker.
What is the underlying tuning algorithm for Automatic Model Tuning?," Currently, the algorithm for tuning hyperparameters is a customized implementation of Bayesian Optimization. It aims to optimize a customer-specified objective metric throughout the tuning process. Specifically, it checks the object metric of completed training jobs, and uses the knowledge to infer the hyperparameter combination for the next training job."
Does Automatic Model Tuning recommend specific hyperparameters for tuning?," No. How certain hyperparameters impact the model performance depends on various factors, and it is hard to definitively say one hyperparameter is more important than the others and thus needs to be tuned. For built-in algorithms within SageMaker, we do call out whether or not a hyperparameter is tunable."
How long does a hyperparameter tuning job take?," The length of time for a hyperparameter tuning job depends on multiple factors, including the size of the data, the underlying algorithm, and the values of the hyperparameters. Additionally, customers can choose the number of simultaneous training jobs and total number of training jobs. All these choices affect how long a hyperparameter tuning job can last."
"Can I optimize multiple objectives simultaneously, such as optimizing a model to be both fast and accurate?"," Not at this time. Currently, you need to specify a single objective metric to optimize or change your algorithm code to emit a new metric, which is a weighted average between two or more useful metrics, and have the tuning process optimize towards that objective metric."
How much does Automatic Model Tuning cost?," There is no charge for a hyperparameter tuning job itself. You will be charged by the training jobs that are launched by the hyperparameter tuning job, based on model training pricing."
How do I decide to use SageMaker Autopilot or Automatic Model Tuning?," SageMaker Autopilot automates everything in a typical ML workflow, including feature preprocessing, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning, while specifically focusing on classification and regression use cases. Automatic Model Tuning, on the other hand, is designed to tune any model, no matter whether it is based on built-in algorithms, deep learning frameworks, or custom containers. In exchange for the flexibility, you have to manually pick the specific algorithm, hyperparameters to tune, and corresponding search ranges."
What is reinforcement learning?, Reinforcement learning is a ML technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.
Can I train reinforcement learning models in SageMaker?," Yes, you can train reinforcement learning models in SageMaker in addition to supervised and unsupervised learning models."
How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?," Though both supervised and reinforcement learning use mapping between input and output, unlike supervised learning where the feedback provided to the agent is the correct set of actions for performing a task, reinforcement learning uses a delayed feedback where reward signals are optimized to ensure a long-term goal through a sequence of actions."
When should I use reinforcement learning?," While the goal of supervised learning techniques is to find the right answer based on the patterns in the training data, the goal of unsupervised learning techniques is to find similarities and differences between data points. In contrast, the goal of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is to learn how to achieve a desired outcome even when it is not clear how to accomplish that outcome. As a result, RL is more suited to enabling intelligent applications where an agent can make autonomous decisions such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, HVAC, industrial control, and more."
What type of environments can I use for training RL models?," Amazon SageMaker RL supports a number of different environments for training RL models. You can use AWS services such as AWS RoboMaker, open-source environments or custom environments developed using Open AI Gym interfaces, or commercial simulation environments such as MATLAB and SimuLink."
Do I need to write my own RL agent algorithms to train RL models?," No, SageMaker RL includes RL toolkits such as Coach and Ray RLLib that offer implementations of RL agent algorithms such as DQN, PPO, A3C, and many more."
Can I bring my own RL libraries and algorithm implementation and run them in SageMaker RL?," Yes, you can bring your own RL libraries and algorithm implementations in Docker Containers and run those in SageMaker RL."
Can I do distributed rollouts using SageMaker RL?, Yes. You can even select a heterogeneous cluster where the training can run on a GPU instance and the simulations can run on multiple CPU instances.
What deployment options does SageMaker provide? ," After you build and train models, SageMaker provides three options to deploy them so you can start making predictions. Real-time inference is suitable for workloads with millisecond latency requirements, payload sizes up to 6 MB, and processing times of up to 60 seconds. Batch transform is ideal for offline predictions on large batches of data that are available up front. Asynchronous inference is designed for workloads that do not have sub-second latency requirements, payload sizes up to 1 GB, and processing times of up to 15 minutes. "
What is Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference?," SageMaker Asynchronous Inference queues incoming requests and processes them asynchronously. This option is ideal for requests with large payload sizes and/or long processing times that need to be processed as they arrive. Optionally, you can configure auto-scaling settings to scale down the instance count to zero when not actively processing requests to save on costs. "
How do I configure auto-scaling settings to scale down the instance count to zero when not actively processing requests?," You can scale down the SageMaker Asynchronous Inference endpoint instance count to zero in order to save on costs when you are not actively processing requests. You need to define a scaling policy that scales on the ApproximateBacklogPerInstance custom metric and set the MinCapacity value to zero. For step-by-step instructions, please visit the autoscale an asynchronous endpoint section of the developer guide. "
What is Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference?," SageMaker Serverless Inference is a purpose-built serverless model serving option that makes it easy to deploy and scale ML models. SageMaker Serverless Inference endpoints automatically start the compute resources and scale them in and out depending on traffic, eliminating the need for you to choose instance type, run provisioned capacity, or manage scaling. You can optionally specify the memory requirements for your serverless inference endpoint. You pay only for the duration of running the inference code and the amount of data processed, not for idle periods."
Why should I use SageMaker Serverless Inference?," SageMaker Serverless Inference simplifies the developer experience by eliminating the need to provision capacity up front and manage scaling policies. SageMaker Serverless Inference can scale instantly from tens to thousands of inferences within seconds based on the usage patterns, making it ideal for ML applications with intermittent or unpredictable traffic. For example, a chatbot service used by a payroll processing company experiences an increase in inquiries at the end of the month while for rest of the month traffic is intermittent. Provisioning instances for the entire month in such scenarios is not cost-effective, as you end up paying for idle periods. SageMaker Serverless Inference helps address these types of use cases by providing you automatic and fast scaling out of the box without the need for you to forecast traffic up front or manage scaling policies. Additionally, you pay only for the compute time to run your inference code (billed in milliseconds) and for data processing, making it a cost-effective option for workloads with intermittent traffic."
What is Provisioned Concurrency for SageMaker Serverless Inference?," Provisioned Concurrency allows you to deploy models on serverless endpoints with predictable performance, and high scalability by keeping your endpoints warm for specified number of concurrent requests. Q. Why should I use Provisioned Concurrency? With on-demand serverless endpoints, if your endpoint does not receive traffic for a while and then your endpoint suddenly receives new requests, it can take some time for your endpoint to spin up the compute resources to process the requests. This is called a cold start. A cold start can also occur if your concurrent requests exceed the current concurrent request usage. The cold start time depends on your model size, how long it takes to download your model, and the start-up time of your container. To reduce variability in your latency profile, you can optionally enable Provisioned Concurrency for your serverless endpoints. With Provisioned Concurrency, your serverless endpoints are always ready and can instantaneously serve bursts in traffic, without any cold starts."
How will I be charged for Provisioned Concurrency?," As with on-demand Serverless Inference, when Provisioned Concurrency is enabled, you pay for the compute capacity used to process inference requests, billed by the millisecond, and the amount of data processed. You also pay for Provisioned Concurrency usage, based on the memory configured, duration provisioned, and amount of concurrency enabled. For more information, see Amazon SageMaker Pricing."
What is SageMaker shadow testing?," SageMaker helps you run shadow tests to evaluate a new ML model before production release by testing its performance against the currently deployed model. SageMaker deploys the new model in shadow mode alongside the current production model and mirrors a user-specified portion of the production traffic to the new model. It optionally logs the model inferences for offline comparison. It also provides a live dashboard with a comparison of key performance metrics, such as latency and error rate, between the production and shadow models to help you decide whether to promote the new model to production."
Why should I use SageMaker for shadow testing?," SageMaker simplifies the process of setting up and monitoring shadow variants so you can evaluate the performance of the new ML model on live production traffic. SageMaker eliminates the need for you to orchestrate infrastructure for shadow testing. It lets you control testing parameters such as the percentage of traffic mirrored to the shadow variant and the duration of the test. As a result, you can start small and increase the inference requests to the new model after you gain confidence in model performance. SageMaker creates a live dashboard displaying performance differences across key metrics, so you can easily compare model performance to evaluate how the new model differs from the production model."
What is Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender?," SageMaker Inference Recommender reduces the time required to get ML models in production by automating performance benchmarking and tuning model performance across SageMaker ML instances. You can now use SageMaker Inference Recommender to deploy your model to an endpoint that delivers the best performance and minimizes cost. You can get started with SageMaker Inference Recommender in minutes while selecting an instance type and get recommendations for optimal endpoint configurations within hours, eliminating weeks of manual testing and tuning time. With SageMaker Inference Recommender, you pay only for the SageMaker ML instances used during load testing, and there are no additional charges."
Why should I use SageMaker Inference Recommender?," You should use SageMaker Inference Recommender if you need recommendations for the right endpoint configuration to improve performance and reduce costs. Previously, data scientists who wanted to deploy their models had to run manual benchmarks to select the right endpoint configuration. They had to first select the right ML instance type out of the 70+ available instance types based on the resource requirements of their models and sample payloads, and then optimize the model to account for differing hardware. Then, they had to conduct extensive load tests to validate that latency and throughput requirements are met and that the costs are low. SageMaker Inference Recommender eliminates this complexity by making it easy for you to: 1) get started in minutes with an instance recommendation; 2) conduct load tests across instance types to get recommendations on your endpoint configuration within hours; and 3) automatically tune container and model server parameters as well as perform model optimizations for a given instance type."
How does SageMaker Inference Recommender work with other AWS services?," Data scientists can access SageMaker Inference Recommender from SageMaker Studio, AWS SDK for Python (Boto3), or AWS CLI. They can get deployment recommendations within SageMaker Studio in the SageMaker model registry for registered model versions. Data scientists can search and filter the recommendations through SageMaker Studio, AWS SDK, or AWS CLI."
Can SageMaker Inference Recommender support multi-model endpoints or multi-container endpoints?," No, we currently support only a single model per endpoint."
What type of endpoints does SageMaker Inference Recommender support?, Currently we support only real-time endpoints.
Can I use SageMaker Inference Recommender in one Region and benchmark in different Regions?," We support all Regions supported by Amazon SageMaker, except the AWS China Regions."
Does SageMaker Inference Recommender support Amazon EC2 Inf1 instances?," Yes, we support all types of containers.
