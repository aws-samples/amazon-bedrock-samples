    "# Retrieval Augmented Question & Answering with Amazon Bedrock using LangChain - Semantic search with metadata filtering with self-querying \n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "LLM question answering (Q+A) typically involves retrieval of documents relevant to the question followed by synthesis of the retrieved chunks into an answer by an LLM.  In practice, the retrieval step is necessary because the LLM context window is limited relative to the size of most text corpus of interest (e.g., LLM context windows range is limited to certain tokens). Anthropic recently released a Claude model with a 100k token context window.  With the advent of models with larger context windows, it is reasonable to wonder whether the document retrieval stage is necessary for many Q+A or chat use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such retriever architectures with this retriever-less option is Semantic search with metadata filtering with self-querying option using Chroma database as vector database. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic with metadata filtering refers to the process of finding items that are both semantically relevant and meet specific filter conditions, such as the availability of a product in stock. In addition to the vector representation, the raw media format (e.g., document or image) contains a list of metadata, such as author and date.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's consider an example of image retrieval, specifically finding shoe images released after a certain date. Embedding the date directly into the vector representation is challenging, but we can overcome this obstacle by employing a combination of vector search and metadata filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we utilize the vector representation to perform similarity searches, looking for images that are visually similar to the query (shoe images). However, to fulfill the additional requirement of being released after a specific date, we leverage the metadata filtering step. By applying the date filter to the list of image metadata, we can identify and retrieve only the shoe images that match the desired release date criteria. This way, we effectively solve the problem of finding shoe images released after a particular date using a combination of vector search and metadata filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have a music library with each song represented by a feature vector (encoded by a deep learning model) and accompanied by metadata such as \"artist,\" \"genre,\" and \"release date.\" We'll explore three strategies for combining vector-based search and metadata filtering in this music library:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pre-selection filtering: In this approach, we first apply metadata filtering to identify a subset of songs that meet certain criteria, such as a specific artist or genre. We then mark these songs as eligible for vector-based similarity search. During the vector search process, we only consider the eligible songs and return the most similar songs from that subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Post-selection filtering: Here, we begin by conducting a vector-based similarity search on the entire music library, finding a subset of songs that are semantically relevant to the query song. Once we have this subset, we then apply metadata filtering to further refine the results and obtain the final list of songs that match both the similarity and metadata criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simultaneous search with filtering: In this strategy, we combine the vector search and metadata filtering steps during the search process itself. As we perform the similarity search on the feature vectors, we immediately filter out any songs that do not meet the specified metadata criteria. The search process continues until we collect the required number of songs that satisfy both similarity and metadata conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A self-querying retriever is a retriever that possesses the unique capability of querying itself. True to its name, this retriever can take any natural language query and use a query-constructing Language Model (LLM) chain to generate a structured query. It then applies this structured query to its underlying VectorStore. Consequently, the retriever can not only perform semantic similarity comparisons between the user's input query and the contents of stored documents but also extract filters from the user's query based on the metadata of these stored documents. Additionally, the retriever can execute these extracted filters to further refine the search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explain how to approach the retriever pattern of semantice search with metadata filtering leveraging self quering with ChromaDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma is the open-source embedding database. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma gives you the tools to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* store embeddings and their metadata\n",
    "* embed documents and queries\n",
    "* search embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma prioritizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* simplicity and developer productivity\n",
    "* analysis on top of search\n",
    "* it also happens to be very quick\n",

    "## Implementation\n",
    "In order to follow the RAG approach this notebook is using the LangChain framework where it has integrations with different services and tools that allow efficient building of patterns such as RAG. We will be using the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Anthropic Claude V1 available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to understand the document chunks and provide an answer in human friendly manner.\n",
    "- **Embeddings Model**: Amazon Titan Embeddings available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to generate a numerical representation of the textual documents\n",
    "- **Document Loader**: PDF Loader available through LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is the loader that can load the documents from a source, for the sake of this notebook we are loading the sample files from a local path. This could easily be replaced with a loader to load documents from enterprise internal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: FAISS available through LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this notebook we are using ChromaDB vector-store to store both the embeddings and the documents. \n",
    "- **Index**: VectorIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "  The index helps to compare the input embedding and the document embeddings to find relevant document\n",
    "- **Wrapper**: wraps index, vector store, embeddings model and the LLM to abstract away the logic from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "To run this notebook you would need to install 2 more dependencies, Lark and ChromaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "Then begin with instantiating the LLM and the Embeddings model. Here we are using Anthropic Claude to demonstrate the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is possible to choose other models available with Bedrock. You can replace the `model_id` as follows to change the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`llm = Bedrock(model_id=\"amazon.titan-tg1-large\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Available models under Bedrock have the following IDs:\n",
    "- `amazon.titan-tg1-large`\n",
    "- `ai21.j2-grande-instruct`\n",
    "- `ai21.j2-jumbo-instruct`\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this moduel on retrieval augmented generation with self-querying meta data filtering! This is an important technique that combines the power of large language models with the precision of retrieval methods. By augmenting generation with relevant retrieved examples, the responses we recieved become more coherent, consistent and grounded. You should feel proud of learning this innovative approach. I'm sure the knowledge you've gained will be very useful for building creative and engaging language generation systems. Well done!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above implementation of RAG based Question Answering we have explored the following concepts and how to implement them using Amazon Bedrock and it's LangChain integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading documents and generating embeddings to create a vector store\n",
    "- Retrieving documents to the question\n",
    "- Preparing a prompt which goes as input to the LLM\n",
    "- Present an answer in a human friendly manner\n",
    "\n",
    "### Take-aways\n",
    "- Experiment with different Vector Stores\n",
    "- Leverage various models available under Amazon Bedrock to see alternate outputs\n",
    "- Explore options such as persistent storage of embeddings and document chunks\n",
    "- Integration with enterprise data stores\n",
