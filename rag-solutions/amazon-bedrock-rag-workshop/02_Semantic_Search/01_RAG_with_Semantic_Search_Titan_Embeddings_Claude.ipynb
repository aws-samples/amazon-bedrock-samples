    "# Retrieval Augmented Question & Answering with Amazon Bedrock using LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to solve a Question Answering task over a larger document corpus with the help of LLMs we need to master the following challenges (amongst others):\n",
    "- How to manage large document(s) that exceed the token limit\n",
    "- How to find the document(s) relevant to the question being asked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infusing knowledge into LLM-powered systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two primary [types of knowledge for LLMs](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain-retrieval-augmentation/): \n",
    "- **Parametric knowledge**: refers to everything the LLM learned during training and acts as a frozen snapshot of the world for the LLM. \n",
    "- **Source knowledge**: covers any information fed into the LLM via the input prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to infuse knowledge into a generative AI - powered application we need to choose which of these types to target. Fine-tuning, explored in other workshops, deals with elevating the parametric knowledge through fine-tuning. Since fine-tuning is a resouce intensive operation, this option is well suited for infusing static domain-specific information like domain-specific langauage/writing styles (medical domain, science domain, ...) or optimizing performance towards a very specific task (classification, sentiment analysis, RLHF, instruction-finetuning, ...). \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to that, targeting the source knowledge for domain-specific performance uplift is very well suited for all kinds of dynamic information, from knowledge bases in structured and unstructured form up to integration of information from live systems. This Lab is about retrieval-augmented generation, a common design pattern for ingesting domain-specific information through the source knowledge. It is particularily well suited for ingestion of information in form of unstructured text with semi-frequent update cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explain how to utilize the RAG (retrieval-agumented generation) pattern originating from [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf) paper published by Lewis et al in 2021. It is particularily useful for Question Answering by finding and leveraging the most useful excerpts of documents out of a larger document corpus providing answers to the user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prepare documents\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/Embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and a stored in a document store index\n",
    "- Load the documents\n",
    "- Process and split them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using Amazon Bedrock Titan Embeddings model\n",
    "- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings\n",
    "#### Ask question\n",
    "![Question](./images/Chatbot_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the documents index is prepared, you are ready to ask the questions and relevant documents will be fetched based on the question being asked. Following steps will be executed.\n",
    "- Create an embedding of the input question\n",
    "- Compare the question embedding with the embeddings in the index\n",
    "- Fetch the (top N) relevant document chunks\n",
    "- Add those chunks as part of the context in the prompt\n",
    "- Send the prompt to the model under Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- Get the contextual answer based on the documents retrieved"

    "## Usecase\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "To explain this architecture pattern we are using PDF documents from IRS. These documents explain topics such as:\n",
    "- Original Issue Discount (OID) Instruments\n",
    "- Reporting Cash Payments of Over $10,000 to IRS\n",
    "- Employer's Tax Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase that we are not bound to a specific domain we also use a txt file containing a cooking recipe for curry. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persona\n",
    "Let's assume a persona of a layman who doesn't have an understanding of how IRS works and if some actions have implications or not. At the same time she wants to occasionaly use the same system for answering questions related to his sparetime, like cooking her favourite dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will try to answer from the documents in easy language.\n"

    "## Implementation\n",
    "In order to follow the RAG approach this notebook is using the LangChain framework where it has integrations with different services and tools that allow efficient building of patterns such as RAG. We will be using the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Anthropic Claude V2 available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to understand the document chunks and provide an answer in human friendly manner.\n",
    "- **Embeddings Model**: Amazon Titan Embeddings available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to generate a numerical representation of the textual documents\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Loader**: \n",
    "    - PDF Loader available through LangChain for PDFs\n",
    "    - TextLoader available through LangChain for txts\n",
    "\n",
    "  These are loaders that can load the documents from a source, for the sake of this notebook we are loading the sample files from a local path. This could easily be replaced with a loader to load documents from enterprise internal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: FAISS available through LangChain\n",
    "  In this notebook we are using this in-memory vector-store to store both the embeddings and the documents. In an enterprise context this could be replaced with a persistent store such as AWS OpenSearch, RDS Postgres with pgVector, ChromaDB, Pinecone or Weaviate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Index**: VectorIndex\n",
    "  The index helps to compare the input embedding and the document embeddings to find relevant document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wrapper**: wraps index, vector store, embeddings model and the LLM to abstract away the logic from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python 3.10\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️⚠️⚠️ For this lab we need to run the notebook based on a Python 3.10 runtime. ⚠️⚠️⚠️\n",
    "\n",
    "If you carry out the workshop from your local environment outside of the Amazon SageMaker studio please make sure you are running a Python runtime > 3.10.\n",

    "To run this notebook you would need to install 2 more dependencies, [PyPDF](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) and [FAISS vector store](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then begin with instantiating the LLM and the Embeddings model. Here we are using Anthropic Claude to demonstrate the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is possible to choose other models available with Bedrock. You can replace the `model_id` as follows to change the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`llm = Bedrock(model_id=\"amazon.titan-tg1-large\")`\n",
    "\n",

    "In the above scenario you explored the quick and easy way to get a context-aware answer to your question. Now let's have a look at a more customizable option with the help of [RetrievalQA](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/vector_db_qa.html) where you can customize how the documents fetched should be added to prompt using `chain_type` parameter. Also, if you want to control how many relevant documents should be retrieved then change the `k` parameter in the cell below to see different outputs. In many scenarios you might want to know which were the source documents that the LLM used to generate the answer, you can get those documents in the output using `return_source_documents` which returns the documents that are added to the context of the LLM prompt. `RetrievalQA` also allows you to provide a custom [prompt template](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/getting_started.html) which can be specific to the model.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this moduel on retrieval augmented generation! This is an important technique that combines the power of large language models with the precision of retrieval methods. By augmenting generation with relevant retrieved examples, the responses we recieved become more coherent, consistent and grounded. You should feel proud of learning this innovative approach. I'm sure the knowledge you've gained will be very useful for building creative and engaging language generation systems. Well done!\n",
