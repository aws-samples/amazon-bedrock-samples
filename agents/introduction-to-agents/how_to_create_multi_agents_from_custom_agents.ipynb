    "<h2>How to create your Multi Agent System with Custom Agents</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Overview</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be first creating an agent from scratch using the Amazon Bedrock Converse API. <strong>This is useful when the existing tools in popular frameworks don't support the type of agent you want to build, or if they have extra bit of code that you don't need for your specific use case or is slowing down your application. Building an agent from scratch also helps you understand how agents work internally.</strong> \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shall leverage it to build a Multi Agent System, where multiple Agents work together to acheive a complex task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let's cover a few important concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are systems that use Large Language Models (LLMs) as their reasoning engines to decide what actions to take and what inputs to provide. After executing actions, the results can be fed back into the LLM to determine if more actions are needed or if it's okay to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents have access to different tools or functions that allow the LLM to interact with external APIs and automate tasks, resolve queries, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a simple agent from scratch. We shall use to build two different agents, one which specializes in collecting information from the web and another that can write and execute code. Then we will use these two agents together to achieve the multi agent orchestration.\n",

    "We will now define the necessary subroutines for our agent to function. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Defining the Tools</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in creating our Agent is to define the tools it can access. In our case, we'll be defining local Python functions, but it's important to note that these tools could be any type of application service. On AWS, these tools might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>An AWS Lambda function</li>\n",
    "<li>A connection to an Amazon RDS database</li>\n",
    "<li>An Amazon DynamoDB table</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples of tools could be:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>REST APIs</li>\n",
    "<li>Data warehouses, data lakes, and databases</li>\n",
    "<li>Computation engines</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For our Agent, we'll define two tools as Python functions with the following abilities:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Retrieve web search results from the DuckDuckGo search engine using natural language as input.</li>\n",
    "<li>Execute Python code provided by the Agent to generate charts using the Matplotlib library.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, we're giving our Agent access to two tools: one that can perform web searches based on natural language queries, and another that can create visual charts and graphs from Python code. These tools will enable our Agent to gather information and present it in a visual format, which can be useful for various tasks and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Following code defines two functions: `chat_generator_from_python_code` and `web_search`. The first function executes Python code to generate a chart, handling any exceptions and returning the result. The second function performs a web search using the DDGS (DuckDuckGo Search) library and returns the search results. Additionally, there's a `call_function` utility that will help us orchestrate the function calls by abstracting the tool name."

    "<h3>Sample Custom Agent</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Following `agent` class is designed to facilitate the interaction between a user and a language model (LLM) through a conversational interface. This implementation allows the LLM to call a single tool at a time, preventing it from getting stuck in a tool-calling loop. However, extending the functionality to plan and handle a series of tool calls can be implemented, albeit non-trivially.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class initializes with a `toolConfig`, `system_prompt`, `messages` which is an optional list and `color` another optional parameter which takes in a string (\"BLACK\", \"RED\", \"GREEN\", \"YELLOW\", \"BLUE\", \"MAGENTA\", \"CYAN\") stating the color of the output print statements of that agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `call_converse_api_with_tools` method invokes the LLM by sending messages and the tool configuration, handling any exceptions that may occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `handle_tool_use` method validates and calls the appropriate tool based on the provided tool name and parameters. If an unexpected tool is used, it raises an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `process_user_input` method is the core of the class. It appends the user's input to the list of messages, invokes the LLM, and processes the response. If the LLM's response includes tool usage instructions, the method calls the specified tool(s) and incorporates the tool's output into the conversation. This process continues until the LLM provides a final answer or the maximum number of retries is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `check_for_final_answer` method checks if the LLM's response includes a final answer to the user's query based on the conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `invoke` method is the entry point for the user's input. It attempts to obtain a final answer by calling `process_user_input` and `check_for_final_answer` methods up to a maximum number of retries. If a final answer is not found within the specified number of retries, it returns the entire conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this agent class provides a conversational interface for users to interact with an LLM while enabling the LLM to leverage external tools. The implementation ensures that the LLM does not get stuck in a tool-calling loop by handling one tool at a time."
